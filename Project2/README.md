# Project 2: Advanced CSS Layout and Responsive Design

## Overview
This project builds on foundational HTML/CSS skills by focusing on advanced layout techniques, the CSS box model, and responsive design principles. Students will create a multi-page website that demonstrates sophisticated CSS styling and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, students will:
- Master the CSS box model (content, padding, border, margin)
- Implement responsive design using media queries and flexible layouts
- Create sophisticated page layouts using CSS Grid and/or Flexbox
- Understand viewport concepts and mobile-first design principles
- Apply advanced CSS selectors and specificity rules
- Optimize websites for multiple devices and screen sizes
- Demonstrate understanding of modern CSS best practices

## Key CSS Skills Emphasized

### 1. Box Model Mastery
- **Content, Padding, Border, Margin:** Understanding how each component affects layout
- **Box-sizing property:** Using `border-box` vs `content-box` effectively
- **Margin collapse:** Managing vertical margin behavior
- **Visual debugging:** Using browser dev tools to inspect the box model

### 2. Responsive Design Principles
- **Mobile-first approach:** Starting with mobile layouts and enhancing for larger screens
- **Media queries:** Creating breakpoints for different device sizes
- **Flexible units:** Using percentages, em, rem, vw, vh instead of fixed pixels
- **Responsive images:** Implementing scalable image solutions

### 3. Modern Layout Techniques
- **CSS Grid:** Creating complex, two-dimensional layouts
- **Flexbox:** Managing one-dimensional layouts and alignment
- **CSS positioning:** Understanding static, relative, absolute, and fixed positioning
- **Float alternatives:** Modern approaches to layout without floats

### 4. Advanced CSS Features
- **CSS variables (custom properties):** Creating maintainable, reusable styles
- **Advanced selectors:** Pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, attribute selectors
- **Transitions and animations:** Adding subtle interactive effects
- **CSS specificity:** Managing cascading styles effectively

## Technical Requirements

### Responsive Breakpoints
Your website must adapt to these minimum screen sizes:
- **Mobile:** 320px - 768px
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1024px  
- **Desktop:** 1024px and above

### Required CSS Techniques
- [ ] Demonstrate understanding of the complete box model
- [ ] Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for main layout structure
- [ ] Implement at least 3 responsive breakpoints with media queries
- [ ] Use relative units (em, rem, %, vw, vh) appropriately
- [ ] Apply box-sizing: border-box to all elements
- [ ] Include hover states and interactive elements
- [ ] Optimize images for different screen densities

### Browser Compatibility
- Must work correctly in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for older browser versions
- Test across multiple devices and screen sizes

## Project Structure

### Preparatory Labs
- **Lab 3:** Box Model Fundamentals and Layout Basics
- **Lab 4:** Responsive Design and Media Queries
