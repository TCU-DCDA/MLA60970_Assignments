# Lab 3: CSS Box Model Fundamentals and Layout Basics

## Assignment Overview
This lab introduces the CSS box model and basic layout techniques that are essential for Project 2. Students will practice manipulating content, padding, border, and margin properties to create well-structured layouts.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Understand the CSS box model components (content, padding, border, margin)
- Practice using box-sizing property effectively
- Apply spacing techniques for visual hierarchy
- Debug layout issues using browser developer tools
- Create basic layouts without relying on float or positioning

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Box Model Exploration
Create an HTML page with CSS that demonstrates each component of the box model.

**Requirements:**
- Create 4 div elements with different box model properties
- Use border, padding, and margin to create distinct visual separation
- Include both `box-sizing: content-box` and `box-sizing: border-box` examples

### Exercise 2: Card Layout Design
Design a responsive card component using only box model properties.

**Requirements:**
- Create a card with image, heading, text content, and button
- Use padding and margin for internal and external spacing
- Apply borders or box-shadow for visual definition
- Ensure the card looks professional and well-spaced
- Test on mobile and desktop screen sizes

### Exercise 3: Navigation Bar Spacing
Create a horizontal navigation bar with proper spacing using box model properties.

**Requirements:**
- Build a navigation with 5-7 menu items
- Use padding and margin to create comfortable click targets
- Apply hover states that work with your spacing choices
- Ensure navigation remains usable on smaller screens

### Exercise 4: Layout Debugging
Fix provided broken layout code that has common box model issues.

**Requirements:**
- Download provided HTML/CSS with spacing problems
- Identify and fix margin collapse issues
- Correct improper box-sizing usage
- Document your fixes and reasoning in comments
