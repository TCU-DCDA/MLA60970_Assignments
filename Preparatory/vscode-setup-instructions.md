- **Restart VS Code** and try opening folder again

### Live Server Not Working
- **Check extension is installed** - Extensions panel → search "Live Server"
- **Right-click HTML file** → ensure "Open with Live Server" option appears
- **Check firewall settings** - may block local server connection

### Code Not Formatting
- **Install Prettier extension**
- **Enable format on save** - Settings → search "format on save"
- **Set Prettier as default formatter** - Settings → search "default formatter"

## Testing Your Setup

Create a simple test file to verify everything works:

1. **Create new file:** `test.html`
2. **Add basic HTML structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>VS Code Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, Web Development!</h1>
    <p>If you can see this in your browser, VS Code is set up correctly.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
3. **Save the file** (should auto-format with Prettier)
4. **Right-click → Open with Live Server**
5. **Verify** the page opens in your browser

If all steps work, you're ready for Lab 1!
