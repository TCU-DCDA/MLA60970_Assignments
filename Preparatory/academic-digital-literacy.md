## What is Digital Communication?

### Beyond Traditional Publishing
Digital communication involves using web tools and platforms to:
- **Enhance accessibility** of your ideas and content
- **Engage broader audiences** beyond traditional circles
- **Create interactive and multimedia** presentations of academic and/or creative work
- **Foster public dialogue** around important topics

## Understanding Web Accessibility

### Who Are Your Web Audiences?
When you move content to the web, you serve multiple audiences:

**Academic and Professional Audiences:**
- Colleagues and professionals in your field
- Students and learners
- Educators and information professionals

**Expanded Public Audiences:**
- General readers interested in your topics
- Community members and local organizations
- Media professionals and communicators

Effective web design IS about:
