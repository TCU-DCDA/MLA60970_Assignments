# Academic Digital Literacy Primer

## Welcome to Digital Scholarship

This primer introduces key concepts that will help you succeed in MLA60970's design-first approach to web development for academic content. As scholars in the Master of Liberal Arts program, you bring deep content knowledge and critical thinking skills—this course will help you extend those capabilities into digital environments.

## What is Digital Scholarship?

### Beyond Traditional Academic Publishing
Digital scholarship involves using digital tools and platforms to:
- **Enhance accessibility** of your research and ideas
- **Engage broader audiences** beyond traditional academic circles
- **Create interactive and multimedia** presentations of scholarly and/or creative work
- **Foster public dialogue** around important intellectual questions
- **Preserve and share** cultural and academic knowledge

### Why Web Skills Matter for Academics
- **Career Development**: Academic institutions increasingly value digital literacy and public engagement
- **Research Impact**: Web-accessible scholarship reaches wider audiences and has greater influence
- **Teaching Enhancement**: Digital skills improve online pedagogy and student engagement
- **Public Service**: Making scholarly knowledge accessible serves democratic and educational goals
- **Collaboration**: Digital platforms enable new forms of scholarly collaboration and community building

## Understanding Web Accessibility in Academic Contexts

### Who Are Your Web Audiences?
When you move academic content to the web, you serve multiple audiences:

**Traditional Academic Audiences:**
- Scholars and researchers in your field
- Graduate and undergraduate students
- Academic librarians and information professionals

**Expanded Public Audiences:**
- Educated general readers interested in your topics
- Journalists and media professionals
- Policy makers and community leaders
- International readers accessing content
- People using assistive technologies or different devices

### Accessibility as Academic Responsibility
Academic accessibility means:
- **Intellectual Accessibility**: Making complex ideas understandable without sacrificing rigor
- **Technical Accessibility**: Ensuring content works for people with different abilities and technologies
- **Economic Accessibility**: Providing free, open access to scholarly and/or creative knowledge
- **Cultural Accessibility**: Considering diverse cultural and linguistic contexts

## Why Design Matters for Academic Credibility

### First Impressions and Scholarly Authority
- **Professional Presentation**: Well-designed content signals serious scholarship
- **Cognitive Load**: Good design reduces the mental effort required to process information
- **Trust and Credibility**: Professional visual presentation enhances reader confidence
- **Attention and Engagement**: Thoughtful design keeps readers focused on your ideas

### Design vs. Decoration
Academic web design is not about:
- Flashy graphics or animations
- Following commercial web trends
- Prioritizing style over substance

Academic web design IS about:
- **Clear information hierarchy** that guides readers through complex arguments
- **Accessible presentation** that serves diverse readers and technologies
- **Professional credibility** that enhances rather than distracts from content
- **User experience** that respects readers' time and cognitive resources
