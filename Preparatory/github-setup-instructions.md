## Basic Workflow for This Course

### Making Changes (Web Interface - Recommended for Beginners)
1. Edit files directly in GitHub's web interface
2. Add a commit message describing your changes
3. Click "Commit changes"
4. Changes appear on your live site within 5-10 minutes

**Why we use the web interface:**
- **No command line needed** - works the same on Mac and PC
- **Immediate publishing** - changes go live automatically
- **Beginner-friendly** - visual interface with clear buttons
- **Cross-platform** - works in any web browser

### Organizing Your Project
- Use folders to organize different projects
- Keep file names lowercase with hyphens: `my-project.html`
- Always include an `index.html` file in each folder

### Alternative: Local Development (Optional)
If you want to work on your computer and upload files:
1. **Download your repository** - Click green "Code" button â†’ "Download ZIP"
2. **Edit files locally** - Use VS Code or any text editor
3. **Upload changes** - Drag and drop files back into GitHub web interface

*We'll focus on the web interface for this course to keep things simple and consistent across different operating systems.*

## Troubleshooting

**Site not loading?**
- Ensure repository is public
- Check that main file is named `index.html`
- Wait 10-15 minutes for changes to appear

**Can't find the "Settings" tab?**
- Make sure you're in your repository (not your profile)
- Look for the Settings tab at the top of your repository page
- Try refreshing the page

**Files not uploading?**
- Check file size (GitHub has limits)
- Ensure file names don't have spaces or special characters
- Try using lowercase letters with hyphens instead

**Need help?**
- Review the video tutorial
- Check GitHub's documentation: [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com)
- Ask questions in class or office hours
- **Remember:** We're using the web interface - no command line needed!
