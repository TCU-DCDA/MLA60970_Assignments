   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My Website</title>
   </head>

3. Commit the file with a message like "Add index.html"
4. Wait 5-10 minutes, then visit your GitHub Pages URL to see your site

## Basic Workflow for This Course

### Recommended Development Workflow
1. **Create and edit files in VS Code** (your primary development environment)
2. **Upload files to GitHub** using the web interface (drag and drop)
3. **Add a commit message** describing your changes
4. **Click "Commit changes"**
5. **Changes appear on your live site** within 5-10 minutes

**Why this hybrid approach works best:**
- **VS Code for development** - professional tools, extensions, Live Server preview
- **GitHub web interface for publishing** - no command line needed, works on Mac and PC
- **Simple and reliable** - visual interface with clear feedback
- **Professional workflow** - mirrors how many teams work

### Alternative: Direct Web Editing (Quick Changes Only)
For small text edits, you can edit files directly in GitHub's web interface:
1. Click the file name, then the pencil icon
2. Make your changes
3. Add commit message and commit changes

**Best for:** Fixing typos, updating text content
**Not ideal for:** Creating new files, major development work

### Organizing Your Project
- Create project folders on your computer for VS Code development
- Keep file names lowercase with hyphens: `my-project.html`
- Always include an `index.html` file in each folder
- Upload organized folder structures to GitHub

### VS Code to GitHub Workflow
1. **Develop locally in VS Code** - use Live Server to preview your work
2. **When ready to publish** - download your repository as ZIP (if needed)
3. **Upload your files** - drag and drop into GitHub web interface
4. **Commit changes** - add descriptive messages about what you updated
5. **View your live site** - check your GitHub Pages URL

*This workflow gives you professional development tools while keeping publishing simple and beginner-friendly.*

## Troubleshooting

**Site not loading?**
- Ensure repository is public
- Check that main file is named `index.html`
- Wait 10-15 minutes for changes to appear

**Can't find the "Settings" tab?**
- Make sure you're in your repository (not your profile)
- Look for the Settings tab at the top of your repository page
- Try refreshing the page

**Files not uploading?**
- Check file size (GitHub has limits)
- Ensure file names don't have spaces or special characters
- Try using lowercase letters with hyphens instead

**Need help?**
- Review the video tutorial
- Check GitHub's documentation: [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com)
- Ask questions in class or office hours
- **Remember:** We're using the web interface - no command line needed!
