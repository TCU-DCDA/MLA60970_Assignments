Part 1: Format the Practice Text
For this exercise, format in Markdown (MD) the following paragraph that explains the relationship between Markdown and HTML. Do not rewrite it—instead, focus on applying Markdown formatting based on the italicized cues within the text. Your goal is to translate these formatting hints into correct Markdown syntax.

Practice Text:
The relationship between Markdown (MD) and HTML is practical and complementary, with Markdown offering a simpler way to write content that eventually becomes HTML behind the scenes. Both are used to structure and display content on the web, but they approach this task differently. HTML relies on a more formal system of tags and attributes, offering complete control over how information is presented, but it can be tedious or intimidating for new users. Markdown, by contrast, was designed to be easy to read and write, even in raw form, which makes it especially popular for note-taking, documentation, and content creation on platforms like GitHub or blogging tools. For example, when you want to call attention to a main idea, this would be a good phrase to put into bold. If you're listing reasons why Markdown is useful—make a bulleted list of the following: it's easier to write than HTML, it doesn't interrupt the flow of writing, and it converts cleanly into valid HTML code. These points would be interpreted by a Markdown parser and rendered as HTML ul and li tags. If your paragraph shifts focus slightly—this would be a good place to insert a subheading, like "Common Use Cases for Markdown"—which could correspond to an h2 tag in HTML. If you mention a website or online resource, this sentence would be a good candidate for a hyperlink, taking readers to more information. You might also insert an image here to visually compare a block of raw MD text next to the same content rendered in HTML. In collaborative writing tools or content management systems, Markdown is commonly used because it allows users to format without writing raw HTML. When quoting another source, this section could be styled as a block quote, which Markdown renders cleanly and accessibly. If you need to reference a command, filename, or short piece of code, this phrase should be formatted as inline code, which helps it stand out. While Markdown is limited in terms of advanced layout or styling, it allows raw HTML to be inserted when needed, which demonstrates the close relationship between the two. Overall, Markdown makes writing for the web faster and more approachable, while HTML remains the underlying language that browsers interpret and display. Used together, they offer both simplicity and precision, which is why they remain such common tools in digital writing and publishing.
