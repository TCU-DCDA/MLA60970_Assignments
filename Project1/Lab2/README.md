# Lab 2: Website Critique and HTML/CSS Implementation

## Overview
This lab combines design analysis with hands-on web development skills. Students will critique a website using professional design principles and then demonstrate their HTML/CSS knowledge by creating a well-structured, scannable web document.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Apply the CRAP design principles to analyze real-world websites
- Write clear, analytical content for web presentation
- Hand-code semantic HTML5 documents
- Implement CSS for typography, layout, and visual hierarchy
- Create web content optimized for scannability and user experience

## Assignment Components

### 1. Website Critique (500-750 words)
Students analyze any website using the **CRAP principles**:
- **Contrast:** Visual differences that create hierarchy
- **Repetition:** Consistent design elements that unify the site
- **Alignment:** Strategic positioning of elements
- **Proximity:** Grouping of related content

### 2. HTML/CSS Implementation
Students convert their critique into a professional web document featuring:
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Internal CSS styling
- Scannability best practices
- Responsive design considerations

## Technical Skills Practiced
- **HTML Elements:** Document structure, headings, semantic elements, lists, links
- **CSS Properties:** Typography, color, spacing, layout
- **Web Standards:** HTML5 validation, cross-browser compatibility
- **User Experience:** Content organization, visual hierarchy, readability
