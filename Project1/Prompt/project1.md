# Project 1: Digital Remediation and Web Publishing

## Your Task

For this project, you will 1) choose something you've written before that you're particularly proud of (a research paper, a short story, a work of creative nonfiction), 2) revise the selected text to expand and deepen its original content, and 3) remediate the selected text by developing a multipage website that will allow you to "publish" the work and share it with a real audience on the internet. By the end of the project, you'll serve as both the final website's content writer and web developer.

Each of you will have to conduct the additional research, revise, plan, and ultimately make your website live. No matter what kind of text you remediate, you should consider issues of usability, design, utility, and, ultimately, the quality of the content you deliver on your site.

While this project may feel quite a bit different than the previous labs, it is important to carry forward the lessons you learned from earlier assignments so that you incorporate complex images that add meaning (and persuasion) to your site. In the end, you will be judged on the content as well as the form, and images are needed for both.

## Required Website Elements

The website must have at least the following elements:

- **Clear, usable navigational scheme**
- **Headings, subheadings, content (as described above), images, and links**
- **At least 5 distinct pages serving different purposes**
- **Use of CSS style sheet(s)**
- **No broken links**
- **A biography page describing who you are and providing context for the page you made (linked from the main site)**

## Development Process

You will have some time to work on this project in class, but you will undoubtedly need to work on it outside of class as well. We will be discussing and using various web development tools in class, but you can always use another editor on your own if you have one you prefer.

At the end of your project, you will write a Cover Memo (see below) that will document your process, the difficulties/successes you've had, and all the things you've had to do in order to accomplish the project. It is equally if not more important that you become aware of your own process, as it is to finish the product, so you should engage in this kind of reflection for the unit's duration.

## Project Assessment

Your web page must be complete and active on the date that it is turned in (into the appropriate dropbox in D2L). It must have all the elements listed above, and you will be evaluated in part on the overall design as well as the content of the site. I will be looking specifically for design elements we have talked about in class and your use of image, layout, design, and color to portray a message consistent with your site's content. This project is not simply a "links page." You should have substantive content on the pages you create based on your selected original text.

## Cover Memo Requirements

In addition to the design and development of the project website, you must also write a short (no more than 1000 words) description of the site. Include in this description the following:

- **A description of your design process, including the challenges and successes**
- **A discussion of how the site's elements function in terms of logos, pathos, and ethos**
- **A discussion of how the elements coordinate in terms of C.R.A.P. and Reading Gravity**
- **A discussion of how your site conforms to the conventions of good web writing and usability**
- **An explanation of how your design makes a visual argument for your suggested reform**

## Getting Started

1. Select your original text for remediation
2. Plan your website structure and navigation
3. Begin content revision and expansion
4. Sketch wireframes for your pages
5. Start developing your site architecture
6. Implement design using HTML/CSS
7. Test for usability and functionality
8. Publish your site
9. Write your cover memo reflection

## Peer Review Process

### Draft Sharing Guidelines
Before the peer review session, you'll share your in-progress website and any specific questions or concerns about your work with your assigned partner. This might include:
- Early wireframes or design sketches
- Partial website implementations
- Content drafts and revision plans
- Specific technical challenges you're facing
- Design decisions you're uncertain about

### Peer Review Letter Requirements
For the Peer Review, please write a thoughtful letter in reply to your selected partner sharing their draft website and materials. In your letter, provide supportive, constructive, and **DETAILED** responses to the observations they've made and the specific questions they ask about their digital remediation project.

Your peer review letter should address:
- **Content and Remediation Strategy**: How effectively is their original content being adapted for web presentation? What suggestions do you have for expanding or revising their material?
- **Technical Implementation**: What works well in their HTML/CSS approach? What technical challenges might they consider addressing?
- **Design and Usability**: How well do their design choices support their content goals? Are there opportunities to better apply CRAP principles or improve navigation?
- **User Experience**: As a potential visitor to their site, what questions do you have? What would enhance the user experience?
- **Specific Questions**: Provide detailed, helpful responses to any specific questions or concerns they've shared

**Without exception, please be respectful, sensitive, and supportive of your partner, their chosen topic, the original work they're remediating, and the draft materials they've submitted for review.** Remember that web development is a learning process, and your role is to help your peer grow and improve their project.

### Peer Review Guidelines
- Focus on being helpful rather than critical
- Offer specific, actionable suggestions
- Ask clarifying questions when appropriate
- Acknowledge what's working well in their project
- Consider both content and technical aspects
- Respect the personal nature of their chosen original work
