# Project 1: Digital Remediation and Web Publishing

## Overview
This project challenges students to transform existing written work into a comprehensive, multi-page website that demonstrates both content development and web design skills. Students will serve as both content creators and web developers, creating a live, published website.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, students will:
- Practice digital remediation techniques
- Develop multi-page website architecture
- Apply advanced HTML/CSS skills in a real-world context
- Integrate design principles (CRAP, Reading Gravity) with content strategy
- Understand the relationship between logos, pathos, and ethos in web design
- Create usable, accessible web content
- Reflect critically on their design and development process

## Project Components

### 1. Content Development
- Select and revise existing written work
- Expand and deepen original content through additional research
- Adapt text for web presentation and multiple page format

### 2. Website Development
- Create at least 5 distinct pages with clear purposes
- Implement navigation scheme and site architecture
- Use CSS for consistent styling and visual hierarchy
- Include meaningful images that support content and persuasion
- Ensure all links function properly

### 3. Critical Reflection
- Write a 1000-word cover memo analyzing the design process
- Discuss rhetorical strategies (logos, pathos, ethos)
- Evaluate design choices using CRAP principles
- Assess usability and web writing conventions
