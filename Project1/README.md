# Project 1: Digital Remediation and Web Publishing

## Overview
This foundational project introduces students to web development by combining content creation with technical implementation. Students will transform existing written work into a professional, multi-page website while learning core HTML/CSS skills and fundamental design principles.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, students will:
- Apply basic HTML document structure and semantic elements
- Implement foundational CSS for typography, color, and layout
- Understand the relationship between content and design
- Practice digital remediation techniques for web publishing
- Develop skills in web writing and content organization
- Create accessible, user-friendly web content
- Reflect critically on design choices and user experience
