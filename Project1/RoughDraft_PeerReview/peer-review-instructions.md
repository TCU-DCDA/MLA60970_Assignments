# Project 1 Peer Review Instructions

## Overview
The peer review process is designed to help you give and receive constructive feedback on your digital remediation projects. This collaborative approach will strengthen both your own work and your ability to provide meaningful feedback to others.

## Draft Sharing Guidelines
Before the peer review session, you'll share your in-progress website and any specific questions or concerns about your work with your assigned partner. This might include:
- Early wireframes or design sketches
- Partial website implementations
- Content drafts and revision plans
- Specific technical challenges you're facing
- Design decisions you're uncertain about

## Peer Review Letter Requirements
For the Peer Review, please write a thoughtful letter in reply to your selected partner sharing their draft website and materials. In your letter, provide supportive, constructive, and **DETAILED** responses to the observations they've made and the specific questions they ask about their digital remediation project.

Your peer review letter should address:
- **Content and Remediation Strategy**: How effectively is their original content being adapted for web presentation? What suggestions do you have for expanding or revising their material?
- **Technical Implementation**: What works well in their HTML/CSS approach? What technical challenges might they consider addressing?
- **Design and Usability**: How well do their design choices support their content goals? Are there opportunities to better apply CRAP principles or improve navigation?
- **User Experience**: As a potential visitor to their site, what questions do you have? What would enhance the user experience?
- **Specific Questions**: Provide detailed, helpful responses to any specific questions or concerns they've shared

**Without exception, please be respectful, sensitive, and supportive of your partner, their chosen topic, the original work they're remediating, and the draft materials they've submitted for review.** Remember that web development is a learning process, and your role is to help your peer grow and improve their project.

## Peer Review Guidelines
- Focus on being helpful rather than critical
- Offer specific, actionable suggestions
- Ask clarifying questions when appropriate
- Acknowledge what's working well in their project
- Consider both content and technical aspects
- Respect the personal nature of their chosen original work

## Review Process Timeline
1. **Draft Submission**: Share your work-in-progress with your assigned partner
2. **Review Period**: Carefully examine your partner's materials and draft your letter
3. **Letter Exchange**: Submit your peer review letter by the specified deadline
4. **Revision Period**: Use the feedback received to improve your project

## What Makes Effective Feedback
- **Specific rather than general**: Instead of "this looks good," try "your navigation menu is clear and easy to use"
- **Balanced**: Point out both strengths and areas for improvement
- **Actionable**: Give suggestions that your partner can actually implement
- **Supportive**: Frame suggestions positively and encouragingly
- **Thorough**: Address multiple aspects of their project comprehensively

## Sample Review Questions to Consider
- How well does the site structure support the content goals?
- Are there any broken links or technical issues to address?
- How effectively do the visual design choices enhance the content?
- Is the navigation intuitive for a first-time visitor?
- How well does the content work for a web audience vs. the original format?
- What questions do you have as a reader/user of this site?

## Submission Requirements
