# Project 1 Rough Draft Instructions

## Overview
For the Rough Draft for Project 1, please submit a ZIP file that includes:
- The complete draft of the site (all HTML files, CSS files, images, etc)
- A complete and thoughtful Draft Reflection (see prompt below)

**DO NOT upload your site's files individually!**

## Prompt for Rough Draft for Project 1
For this draft, each page of your site should include all of the following:
- A fully functioning navigation bar (for internal navigation)
- Links to external sites (for citation of individual sources as well as Works Cited)
- Something of visual interest and relevance (for example, images, video, charts, maps, etc)
- Content formatted following the web-writing guidelines detailed in the lecture Reading Gravity & Writing for the Web

## Prompt for Draft Reflection Letter
Before you submit your Rough Draft for Project 1, take some time to draft a Draft Reflection Letter (as a Word doc, between 300 to 500 words). In your letter, please dedicate a short paragraph to each of the following bullet points as a way of giving your peer reviewers insight into 1) what your intentions are for the draft, 2) what you think you've accomplished so far, and 3) what you still think you need to do to make your project even better.

- **Summarize your project** in one or two sentences.
- **What surprised you** while you were crafting your current draft (the full website)?
- **What aspect(s) of this most recent draft** presented the greatest challenge for you?
- **What successes** resulted from the project?
- **What is your vision** for the final drafts of the project?
- **Enumerate three craft-based questions** about your project that you'd like your peers to address in their written replies. What do you need help with technically or conceptually? What are you still trying to sort out? (Ask real questions! The more thoughtful the questions, the better your feedback will be!)
- Also, **include in your letter a statement** indicating if you are open to feedback in addition to what you've requested above. May your groupmates offer feedback about things you've not asked about?

## Submission Guidelines

### Technical Requirements
- Submit as a single ZIP file containing all project materials
- Ensure all links within your site work correctly
- Include all necessary CSS files, images, and other assets
- Test your site locally before submission to ensure everything functions

### Reflection Letter Requirements
- 300-500 words in length
- Address all bullet points listed above
- Submit as a Word document
- Include specific questions for peer reviewers
- Be honest about challenges and successes

### File Organization
Your ZIP file should be organized clearly:
```
YourName_Project1_RoughDraft.zip
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── [other HTML pages]
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── images/
│   └── [your image files]
└── DraftReflection_YourName.docx
```

## What Happens Next
After you submit your rough draft:
1. Your materials will be shared with your assigned peer reviewer
2. You'll receive a peer's draft to review using the peer review guidelines
3. You'll write a detailed peer review letter in response
4. You'll receive feedback from your peer to help improve your final project
5. Use the feedback to revise and enhance your final submission

## Tips for Success
- **Start early** - Don't wait until the last minute to compile your materials
- **Test thoroughly** - Make sure all links work and images display correctly
- **Be specific in your reflection** - Generic responses won't help your peer reviewers give you useful feedback
- **Ask meaningful questions** - The better your questions, the more helpful the feedback you'll receive
- **Document your process** - Keep notes about challenges and decisions as you work
