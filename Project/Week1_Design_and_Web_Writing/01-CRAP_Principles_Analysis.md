# Week 1: Design Principles and Web Writing

## Assignment Overview
This foundational week introduces essential concepts for making your ideas accessible and engaging online. You'll learn CRAP design principles, understand how web reading differs from print reading, and begin planning how to transform your academic and/or creative work for web audiences.

## Required Preparation
Before beginning this week, watch these videos:
- **"Artificiality of Academic Writing"** - Understand why web writing requires different approaches
- **"CRAP Principles"** - Learn the four fundamental design principles you'll analyze

## Learning Objectives
By completing this week, students will:
- Understand CRAP design principles and how they make websites more effective
- Analyze web reading patterns (F-pattern, layer cake) and what they mean for your content
- Apply web writing principles to make complex ideas more accessible
- Evaluate how design choices affect whether people can find and understand your work
- Begin planning how to share your own work online

## Week Exercises

### Exercise 1: CRAP Principles Analysis
Learn the foundation design principles by analyzing how they work on real websites.

**The CRAP Principles:**
- **Contrast**: Visual differences that create hierarchy and guide attention
- **Repetition**: Consistent design elements that create unity and help readers navigate
- **Alignment**: Positioning elements to create clear visual relationships
- **Proximity**: Grouping related information to show relationships and meaning

**Requirements:**
- **Choose a website with substantial content** (university site, online magazine, blog, portfolio, etc.)
- **Analyze using each CRAP principle** with specific focus on how design choices help or hinder readers
- **Write 300-400 word analysis** with specific examples and one screenshot per principle
- **Focus on effectiveness**: Do the design choices make the content easy to find and understand?

### Exercise 2: Web Reading Patterns and Academic Content
Understand how web reading differs from print reading and what this means for academic writing.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Reading Gravity**: How images and color pull attention away from text
- **F-Pattern/Layer Cake Pattern**: How users scan rather than read web content carefully
- **Scannability**: Making content accessible to users who are scanning for key information

**Requirements:**
- **Analyze a substantial piece of academic writing** (journal article, research paper, etc.)
- **Identify challenges** this content would face in web environment based on reading patterns
- **Create a "web writing" version** of one section (200-300 words) applying scannability principles:
  - Shorter paragraphs (100 words or less)
  - Strategic headings and subheadings
  - Key concepts emphasized (note where you would use bold formatting)
  - Bullet or numbered lists for key takeaways
- **Write brief comparison** (150-200 words) explaining your revision choices

### Exercise 3: Content Strategy for Academic Remediation
Begin planning how to transform academic work for web publication.

**Requirements:**
- **Choose your own academic work** for the final remediation project (research paper, essay, creative work, etc.)
- **Audience analysis**: Compare your original academic audience with potential web readers (150-200 words)
- **Structure planning**: Outline how you would break content into 4-5 scannable web pages
- **Create content strategy overview** (300-400 words) addressing:
  - Why this work deserves broader accessibility
  - Main challenges in web transformation
  - Initial ideas for visual hierarchy and navigation

## Assessment Criteria

**Developing (Emerging Understanding):**
- CRAP analysis identifies some design elements but lacks depth or accuracy
- CSS implementation shows basic understanding but may have significant issues
- Limited application of scannability principles
- Design planning is superficial or unrealistic

**Proficient (Good Understanding):**
- CRAP analysis demonstrates solid understanding with specific examples
- CSS implementation effectively creates visual hierarchy and organization
- Good application of scannability principles improves content accessibility
- Design planning shows thoughtful consideration of user needs and goals

**Advanced (Strong Understanding):**
- CRAP analysis provides sophisticated insights into how design affects scholarly communication
- Content remediation successfully maintains academic rigor while dramatically improving web accessibility
- Typography implementation demonstrates advanced understanding of reading experience optimization
- Design planning shows comprehensive consideration of academic audience needs and content strategy
- Clear evidence of understanding how design principles support intellectual engagement

## Professional Development Focus
This week emphasizes skills directly applicable to:
- Digital humanities and scholarly communication
- Academic publishing and editorial work
- Content strategy for educational and cultural institutions
- User experience design for knowledge-based websites
- Public scholarship and community engagement initiatives

## Resources and Tools
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) with focus on reading-optimized typefaces
- [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) for accessibility
- Examples of successful academic websites
- [Typography resources for academic content](https://practicaltypography.com/)
- Digital humanities project showcases for design inspiration

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit academic website analysis with annotated screenshots
- Submit original and remediated content versions with HTML/CSS implementation
- Submit typography comparison with analysis of scholarly reading considerations
- Submit design planning documents for remediation project
- Include reflection on how design principles specifically serve academic content and audiences

*This week develops critical design analysis skills while building practical CSS implementation abilities specifically focused on academic content needs.*
