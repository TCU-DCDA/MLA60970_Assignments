# Week 1, Exercise 2: Content Strategy Planning

## Assignment Overview
This exercise focuses on **planning your web project**. You'll select academic and/or creative work to transform for web publication and develop a strategy for making that content accessible, engaging, and effective for web audiences while keeping what makes it valuable.

## Required Preparation
Before beginning this exercise, watch these videos:
- **"Reading Gravity"** - Understand how people read on screens and what this means for your content
- **"Writing for the Web"** - Learn specific techniques for formatting content that works well online

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, students will:
- Select appropriate academic and/or creative work for web adaptation
- Understand the differences between print and web reading behaviors
- Develop audience-centered strategies for sharing your work online
- Plan content transformation that keeps quality while improving accessibility
- Create a roadmap for your multipage website project

## Exercise 1: Work Selection and Analysis

### Part A: Content Selection
Choose substantial academic and/or creative work that you'll adapt throughout this course.

**Acceptable Work Types:**
- **Academic work:** Research papers, thesis chapters, presentations, essays
- **Creative work:** Poetry collections, short stories, creative nonfiction, multimedia projects
- **Hybrid work:** Creative-critical writing, interdisciplinary projects

**Selection Criteria:**
1. **Substantial content** (minimum 3,000-5,000 words or equivalent creative work)
2. **Personal investment** - work you're genuinely proud of and want to share
3. **Sharing potential** - content that could benefit or interest others
4. **Web adaptation potential** - work that can be meaningfully adapted for online
5. **Rights ownership** - work you have permission to publish and adapt

**Required Analysis:**
- **Content summary** (200-300 words)
- **Why this work matters** to you and potential audiences
- **Current format limitations** and opportunities for web enhancement

### Part B: Audience Analysis
Analyze how your audience will change when moving from academic/artistic contexts to web publication.

**Original Audience Analysis:**
1. **Primary audience** for your original work
2. **Expertise level** and background knowledge assumed
3. **Reading context** (academic setting, artistic community, etc.)
4. **Access barriers** (academic paywalls, specialized venues, etc.)

**Web Audience Expansion:**
1. **New potential audiences** who could benefit from this work
2. **Varied expertise levels** you'll need to accommodate
3. **Different reading contexts** (casual browsing, research, sharing)
4. **Accessibility considerations** for diverse abilities and technologies

**Deliverable:** Audience comparison chart showing original vs. web audiences.

### Part C: Reading Behavior Analysis
Understand how web reading differs from academic/artistic reading contexts.

*Reference the "Reading Gravity" and "Writing for the Web" videos for key concepts in this section.*

**Print vs. Web Reading Patterns:**
1. **Linear vs. non-linear** reading expectations
2. **Deep vs. scanning** reading behaviors
3. **Attention spans** and information processing differences
4. **Device considerations** (desktop, mobile, tablet reading)

**Web-Specific Considerations:**
1. **F-pattern reading** - how readers scan web content (from "Reading Gravity" video)
2. **Layer cake pattern** - readers look for "icing" and skip "cake" content
3. **Chunking expectations** - breaking content into digestible sections
4. **Navigation needs** - how readers move through multipage content
5. **Search and discovery** - how people find and share content

**Deliverable:** Reading behavior analysis with implications for your content structure.

## Exercise 2: Content Transformation Strategy

### Part A: Content Architecture Planning
Design the structure for your multipage website.

### Part B: Accessibility and Inclusion Strategy
Plan how you'll make your work more accessible than its original format.

**Accessibility Planning:**
1. **Language Accessibility**

   - What alt text and descriptions will images need?
   - How will you structure content for keyboard navigation?

3. **Cognitive Accessibility**
   - How will you reduce cognitive load without dumbing down content?
   - What visual cues will help readers navigate complex ideas?
   - How will you provide multiple entry points for different learning styles?

4. **Economic Accessibility**
   - How does free web publication remove economic barriers?
   - What assumptions about access or resources should you reconsider?

**Deliverable:** Accessibility plan with specific implementation strategies.

### Part C: Enhancement and Value-Add Strategy
Identify opportunities to improve your work through digital remediation.

**Web-Specific Enhancements:**
1. **Linking and Context**
   - Internal links to connect related concepts
   - External links to sources and further reading
   - Contextual explanations and definitions

2. **Visual Elements**
   - Images, diagrams, or visualizations that support your content
   - Typography and layout that enhance readability
   - Color and design that reinforce your message
