# Discussion 2: Navigating Design and Content Challenges

**Timing:** Week 2-3 - After completing Lab 1 (Design Principles) and working through Lab 2 (HTML Fundamentals)  
**Purpose:** Share challenges, celebrate breakthroughs, and learn from each other's problem-solving approaches

## Discussion Prompt

### **"From Academic Writing to Web Design: What We're Learning"**

Now that you've begun translating your academic work into web-friendly design and content, share your discoveries with the learning community:

#### **1. Your Design Revelation** 
What's one thing about design thinking or web communication that surprised you? Consider:
- How the CRAP principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) changed your perspective
- Insights from analyzing academic websites in Lab 1
- Moments when you realized something about reading gravity or user attention
- "Aha!" moments about accessibility or inclusive design

#### **2. Your Translation Challenge** 
What's been the most difficult aspect of adapting your academic content for web audiences? Share:
- Specific sentences or concepts that resist simplification
- Moments when you worried about "dumbing down" your work
- Tensions between scholarly precision and accessible communication
- Technical or design obstacles you're working through

#### **3. Your Problem-Solving Process** 
Describe how you approached one specific challenge. For example:
- How did you decide what to cut, keep, or completely rewrite?
- What strategies help you maintain scholarly integrity while improving accessibility?
- How are you thinking about visual hierarchy for complex ideas?
- What resources (outside readings, examples, tools) proved most helpful?

#### **4. Your Audience-Centered Insight** 
How has considering your target audience changed your writing or design choices? Share:
- A specific moment when you thought "my audience would need..." 
- How you're balancing expert knowledge with newcomer needs
- Ways you're anticipating questions or confusion
- Strategies for maintaining engagement without sacrificing depth

#### **5. Your Community Question** 
What would be most helpful to hear from classmates? Pose:
- A specific design or content challenge you'd like input on
- A request for examples or resources related to your topic
- A question about balancing competing demands in web communication
- A technical issue where you'd welcome collaborative problem-solving

## Participation Options

### **Problem-Solving Post (300-400 words)**
Focus on sharing one challenge and your approach, then pose a specific question for community input.

### **Visual Documentation**
Include screenshots of:
- Before/after comparisons of content revision
- Design sketches or wireframes you're working with
- Examples from other sites that inspire or inform your approach
- HTML/CSS experiments (even if imperfect!)

### **Process Reflection Video (2-3 minutes)**
Walk through your screen while explaining:
- A design decision you made and why
- A content challenge you're working through
- Your evolving understanding of your target audience
