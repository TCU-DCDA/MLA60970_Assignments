# Lab 2: HTML Fundamentals and Basic CSS Implementation

## Assignment Overview
Building on the design principles and web writing strategies from Lab 1, this lab focuses on implementing HTML fundamentals with basic CSS styling. You'll apply your understanding of CRAP principles and web reading patterns to create properly structured, styled HTML documents that demonstrate both semantic markup and visual design principles.

## Required Preparation
This lab builds directly on concepts from previous videos:
- **"HTML Basics for Content"** - Review fundamental HTML structure and semantic elements
- **"From Design Principles to HTML and CSS"** - Apply CRAP principles using both HTML structure and basic CSS styling

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Create properly structured HTML5 documents that implement design principles from Lab 1
- Apply basic CSS styling to enhance visual hierarchy and implement CRAP principles
- Use semantic HTML elements to enhance content accessibility, navigation, and meaning
- Connect design theory to practical HTML and CSS implementation
- Demonstrate understanding of how structure and style work together for effective web communication

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: From Markdown to HTML with Design Awareness
Convert a formatted text document from Markdown to HTML, applying your understanding of visual hierarchy and reading patterns from Lab 1.

**Required Markdown Commands to Use:**
- Bold text → `**text**` (implement Contrast principle)
- Italic text → `*text*` (subtle emphasis within hierarchy)
- Inline code → `` `text` `` (specialized information formatting)
- Block quote → `>` (Proximity principle - grouping related ideas)
- Heading → `# Heading` (clear visual hierarchy for scanning)
- Subheading → `## Heading` (support F-pattern reading)
- Hyperlink → `[text](URL)` (enable non-linear navigation)
- Show Image → `![alt text](URL)` (manage reading gravity)
- Bulleted list → `- item` (scannability for key information)

**Practice Text with Design Considerations:**
Format the following paragraph in Markdown, then convert it to HTML. Apply formatting based on the italicized cues AND your understanding of web reading patterns and visual hierarchy.

*The relationship between Markdown (MD) and HTML is practical and complementary, with Markdown offering a simpler way to write content that eventually becomes HTML behind the scenes. Both are used to structure and display content on the web, but they approach this task differently. HTML relies on a more formal system of tags and attributes, offering complete control over how information is presented, but it can be tedious or intimidating for new users. Markdown, by contrast, was designed to be easy to read and write, even in raw form, which makes it especially popular for note-taking, documentation, and content creation on platforms like GitHub or blogging tools. For example, when you want to call attention to a main idea, **this would be a good phrase to put into bold**. If you're listing reasons why Markdown is useful—make a bulleted list of the following: it's easier to write than HTML, it doesn't interrupt the flow of writing, and it converts cleanly into valid HTML code. These points would be interpreted by a Markdown parser and rendered as HTML ul and li tags. If your paragraph shifts focus slightly—**this would be a good place to insert a subheading, like "Common Use Cases for Markdown"**—which could correspond to an h2 tag in HTML. If you mention a website or online resource, **this sentence would be a good candidate for a hyperlink**, taking readers to more information. You might also insert an image here to visually compare a block of raw MD text next to the same content rendered in HTML. In collaborative writing tools or content management systems, Markdown is commonly used because it allows users to format without writing raw HTML. When quoting another source, **this section could be styled as a block quote**, which Markdown renders cleanly and accessibly. If you need to reference a command, filename, or short piece of code, **this phrase should be formatted as inline code**, which helps it stand out. While Markdown is limited in terms of advanced layout or styling, it allows raw HTML to be inserted when needed, which demonstrates the close relationship between the two. Overall, Markdown makes writing for the web faster and more approachable, while HTML remains the underlying language that browsers interpret and display. Used together, they offer both simplicity and precision, which is why they remain such common tools in digital writing and publishing.*

### Exercise 2: Semantic HTML Implementation for Academic Content
Create a complete HTML5 document that implements both semantic structure AND the design principles learned in Lab 1.

**Required HTML Elements:**
- Document structure: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Meta information: `<meta charset="">`, `<meta name="viewport">`, `<title>`
- Academic content elements: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<article>`, `<section>`
- Text formatting: `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<blockquote>`, `<cite>`
- Lists and references: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` for bibliographies or key points
- Links: `<a href="">` for citations and external references
- Semantic elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`

**Requirements:**
- Take the web-optimized content you developed in Lab 1 Exercise 2 and mark it up with semantic HTML
- Implement clear heading hierarchy that supports F-pattern scanning
- Use semantic elements to show the relationships between content sections (Proximity principle)
- Include proper links and navigation elements for non-linear reading
- Structure lists and emphasis to enhance scannability
- Add semantic landmarks that will support accessibility and CSS styling in later labs
- Validate your HTML using W3C Markup Validator

**Design Implementation Notes:**
Your HTML structure should reflect your Lab 1 analysis of:
- How headings create visual hierarchy (Contrast)
- How grouping elements support content relationships (Proximity)
- How consistent markup creates predictable patterns (Repetition)
- How alignment of elements will be achieved through semantic structure

### Exercise 3: Multi-Page Structure Planning and Implementation
Apply your content strategy from Lab 1 by creating the HTML structure for your remediation project.

**Requirements:**
- **Use your content strategy from Lab 1 Exercise 3** - the academic work you selected for remediation
- **Create HTML file structure** for the 4-5 web pages you outlined in your Lab 1 planning
- **For each page, create**:
  - Complete HTML5 document structure
  - Semantic markup that reflects your content hierarchy
  - Navigation elements that connect the pages
  - Proper heading structure for web scanning patterns
- **Implement your design insights**:
  - Use HTML structure to support the CRAP principles you analyzed
  - Create markup that will enable the visual hierarchy you planned
  - Structure content to support the web reading patterns you identified
- **Write a technical reflection** (300-400 words) analyzing:
  - How HTML semantic elements support your design strategy
  - Where you see opportunities for CSS enhancement (upcoming in Lab 3)
  - How the markup structure addresses the accessibility concerns you identified in Lab 1
  - What you learned about the relationship between content strategy and technical implementation

## Assessment Criteria

**Developing (Emerging Understanding):**
- HTML document has basic structure but may contain validation errors
- Some semantic elements used, but choices don't reflect Lab 1 design insights
- Limited connection between content strategy from Lab 1 and technical implementation

**Proficient (Good Understanding):**
- HTML document is well-structured, validates, and reflects design awareness from Lab 1
- Appropriate semantic elements used to support content hierarchy and navigation
- Clear evidence of applying web writing and design principles through markup choices
- HTML structure effectively prepares content for CSS implementation in Lab 3

**Advanced (Strong Understanding):**
- HTML demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how semantic markup serves both design and accessibility goals
- Seamless integration of Lab 1 insights (CRAP principles, reading patterns) into technical implementation
- HTML structure anticipates and enables complex design solutions for later labs
- Content remediation shows mastery of the relationship between strategy and technical execution
- Clear evidence of understanding how semantic HTML supports scholarly communication goals
