# Lab 2: Design Principles and Website Critique

## Assignment Overview
This lab focuses on understanding and applying fundamental design principles to web development. You'll analyze existing websites using the CRAP design principles and begin implementing visual hierarchy and typography in your own work.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Understand and apply CRAP design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity)
- Analyze websites critically using design theory
- Implement basic CSS typography and visual hierarchy
- Apply scannability principles to web content
- Develop design vocabulary and critical analysis skills

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: CRAP Analysis and Website Critique
Write a comprehensive website critique applying the CRAP design principles to analyze design effectiveness.

**Choose any website and analyze using the CRAP principles:**

**Contrast:** How does the site use visual differences (color, size, weight, typography) to create hierarchy and guide attention? Are important elements emphasized appropriately?

**Repetition:** What design elements are repeated throughout the site to create unity and consistency? Look at colors, fonts, spacing, button styles, and layout patterns.

**Alignment:** How are elements positioned relative to each other? Is there a clear visual connection between related items? Does the alignment create a clean, organized appearance?

**Proximity:** How does the grouping of related elements help users understand the site's organization? Are related items grouped together and unrelated items separated?

**Your critique should:**
- Identify specific examples of each CRAP principle
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the design choices
- Suggest concrete improvements where appropriate
- Be 500-750 words in length
- Include screenshots or specific examples to support your analysis

### Exercise 2: CSS Typography and Visual Hierarchy
Create an HTML/CSS implementation that demonstrates design principles and scannability.

**Required CSS Properties:**
- Typography: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing`
- Color: `color`, `background-color`, `opacity`
- Spacing: `margin`, `padding`, `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`
- Layout: `width`, `max-width`, `text-align`
- Visual effects: `border`, `box-shadow`, `border-radius`

**Requirements:**
- Convert your critique into a well-structured HTML document
- Implement clear visual hierarchy using typography
- Apply scannability principles (see guidelines below)
- Use CSS to create contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity
- Ensure the design supports and enhances your content

**Scannability Requirements:**
- Use descriptive headings that break up content into logical sections
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences maximum)
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key points
- Implement visual hierarchy through font sizes, weights, and spacing
- Ensure adequate white space between sections
- Use consistent styling throughout
- Create clear visual relationships between related content

### Exercise 3: Typography Comparison
Explore how typography choices affect readability and user experience.

**Requirements:**
- Create three versions of the same content using different typography approaches:
  1. Poor typography (demonstrate common mistakes)
  2. Adequate typography (basic but functional)
  3. Excellent typography (demonstrates advanced understanding)
- Write a brief analysis comparing the three versions
- Consider factors like readability, hierarchy, aesthetic appeal, and accessibility

### Exercise 4: Portfolio Design Planning
Begin planning the visual design for your final portfolio project.

**Requirements:**
- Create a basic style guide for your portfolio including:
  - Color palette (3-5 colors)
  - Typography choices (headings and body text)
  - Spacing and layout principles
- Sketch or wireframe your portfolio's main pages
- Consider how CRAP principles will guide your design decisions
- Plan how your design will reflect your personal brand or professional goals

## Assessment Criteria

**Developing (Emerging Understanding):**
- CRAP analysis identifies some design elements but lacks depth or accuracy
- CSS implementation shows basic understanding but may have significant issues
- Limited application of scannability principles
- Design planning is superficial or unrealistic

**Proficient (Good Understanding):**
- CRAP analysis demonstrates solid understanding with specific examples
- CSS implementation effectively creates visual hierarchy and organization
- Good application of scannability principles improves content accessibility
- Design planning shows thoughtful consideration of user needs and goals

**Advanced (Strong Understanding):**
- CRAP analysis is sophisticated and provides valuable insights
- CSS implementation demonstrates advanced understanding of typography and layout
- Excellent application of scannability principles creates highly usable content
- Design planning is comprehensive and shows consideration for accessibility and user experience
- Clear integration between analysis, implementation, and planning activities
