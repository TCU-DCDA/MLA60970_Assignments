# Lab 2: Design Principles and Academic Content Strategy

## Assignment Overview
This lab focuses on applying fundamental design principles to scholarly and academic content for web publication. You'll analyze how design choices affect the readability and accessibility of intellectual work while beginning the content transformation process for your remediation project.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Understand and apply CRAP design principles to academic and scholarly content
- Analyze how design affects the accessibility and impact of intellectual work
- Implement CSS typography and visual hierarchy optimized for reading complex content
- Apply content strategy principles to transform academic writing for web audiences
- Develop critical analysis skills for evaluating digital scholarly publishing

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Academic Website Analysis Using CRAP Principles
Analyze how design principles affect the presentation and accessibility of scholarly content online.

**Choose an academic or scholarly website and analyze using the CRAP principles:**

**Contrast:** How does the site use visual differences to create hierarchy in complex academic content? Are important concepts, headings, and citations properly emphasized? How does contrast help readers navigate dense information?

**Repetition:** What design elements create consistency across different types of content (articles, bibliographies, author information)? How do repeated elements help readers understand the site's organization and credibility?

**Alignment:** How are academic elements (citations, quotes, headings, body text) positioned to create clear relationships? Does the alignment support the logical flow of scholarly argument?

**Proximity:** How does grouping help readers understand relationships between concepts, sources, and different sections of academic work? Are related materials appropriately clustered?

**Your analysis should:**
- Focus specifically on how design choices affect academic content accessibility
- Evaluate how effectively the design serves readers engaging with complex intellectual material
- Consider diverse audiences (scholars, students, general public) and their different needs
- Be 500-750 words with specific examples and screenshots
- Suggest improvements that would enhance scholarly communication

### Exercise 2: Content Strategy for Academic Remediation
Begin transforming your chosen academic work for web publication using design and content strategy principles.

**Requirements:**
- **Take a substantial section** (500-800 words) from your chosen academic work
- **Rewrite it for web audiences** applying scannability principles while maintaining intellectual rigor
- **Create HTML/CSS implementation** that demonstrates thoughtful design choices
- **Compare original and remediated versions** in a brief analysis

**Content Transformation Guidelines:**
- Break long paragraphs into shorter, scannable sections
- Create descriptive subheadings that guide readers through complex arguments
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key concepts or evidence
- Add strategic emphasis (bold, italics) to highlight important ideas
- Consider where links to external sources or definitions might help readers
- Maintain academic integrity and nuance while improving accessibility

**Required CSS Properties:**
- Typography: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing`
- Color: `color`, `background-color`, `opacity`
- Spacing: `margin`, `padding`, `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`
- Layout: `width`, `max-width`, `text-align`
- Visual effects: `border`, `box-shadow`, `border-radius`

**CSS Implementation Requirements:**
- External stylesheet optimized for reading complex content
- Typography choices that enhance readability and comprehension
- Visual hierarchy that guides readers through academic arguments
- Responsive design considerations for different reading contexts
- Strategic use of white space to prevent cognitive overload

**Analysis Component:**
- 300-400 word comparison of original vs. remediated versions
- Discussion of specific choices made and their rationale
- Reflection on challenges in maintaining academic rigor while improving accessibility

### Exercise 3: Typography for Academic Reading
Explore how typography choices specifically affect the reading of scholarly content.

**Requirements:**
- Create three versions of the same academic content using different typography approaches:
  1. Typography that hinders academic reading (demonstrate common problems)
  2. Adequate typography for scholarly content (functional but basic)
  3. Excellent typography that enhances intellectual engagement
- Focus on factors critical for academic content: readability of dense text, hierarchy for complex arguments, citation formatting, etc.
- Write analysis comparing how typography choices affect comprehension of scholarly material

### Exercise 4: Digital Remediation Design Planning
Plan the visual design strategy for your final remediation project.

**Requirements:**
- Create a design strategy document including:
  - Color palette appropriate for academic content (3-4 colors emphasizing readability)
  - Typography system for headings, body text, citations, and special content
  - Layout principles that support logical flow of scholarly argument
  - Accessibility considerations for diverse academic audiences
- Consider how CRAP principles will help readers navigate complex intellectual content
- Plan how design choices will enhance rather than distract from scholarly communication

## Assessment Criteria

**Developing (Emerging Understanding):**
- CRAP analysis identifies some design elements but lacks depth or accuracy
- CSS implementation shows basic understanding but may have significant issues
- Limited application of scannability principles
- Design planning is superficial or unrealistic

**Proficient (Good Understanding):**
- CRAP analysis demonstrates solid understanding with specific examples
- CSS implementation effectively creates visual hierarchy and organization
- Good application of scannability principles improves content accessibility
- Design planning shows thoughtful consideration of user needs and goals

**Advanced (Strong Understanding):**
- CRAP analysis provides sophisticated insights into how design affects scholarly communication
- Content remediation successfully maintains academic rigor while dramatically improving web accessibility
- Typography implementation demonstrates advanced understanding of reading experience optimization
- Design planning shows comprehensive consideration of academic audience needs and content strategy
- Clear evidence of understanding how design principles support intellectual engagement
