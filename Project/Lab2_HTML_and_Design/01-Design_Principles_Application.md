# Lab 2, Exercise 1: Design Principles Application

## Assignment Overview
Building on your CRAP principles analysis from Lab 1, this exercise focuses on **applying** design principles to your own content. You'll take the design insights you gained from analyzing academic and/or creative websites and use them to plan the visual structure of your remediation project.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, students will:
- Apply CRAP principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) to their own content planning
- Understand how design principles translate into HTML structure decisions
- Create a visual hierarchy plan that supports web reading patterns
- Bridge the gap between design analysis and technical implementation

## Exercise 1: CRAP Principles Planning for Your Remediation Project

### Part A: Content Inventory and Grouping (Proximity)
Using the academic and/or creative work you selected in Lab 1 for remediation, organize your content according to proximity principles.

**Required Analysis:**
1. **Content Chunking**
   - Break your original work into logical sections
   - Group related information together
   - Identify content that should be visually separated

2. **Information Hierarchy**
   - Primary content (main arguments/themes)
   - Secondary content (supporting details)
   - Tertiary content (citations, footnotes, metadata)

3. **Navigation Planning**
   - How will readers move through your content?
   - What content relationships need to be visually clear?

**Deliverable:** Create a content outline that shows how you'll group information on your website.

### Part B: Visual Hierarchy Design (Contrast)
Plan how you'll use contrast to guide readers through your remediated content.

**Required Planning:**
1. **Typographic Contrast**
   - Heading levels and their visual weight
   - Body text treatment
   - Special content (quotes, citations, callouts)

2. **Color Contrast Strategy**
   - Primary color for emphasis and navigation
   - Background and text color relationships
   - Accessibility considerations for contrast ratios

3. **Size and Weight Contrast**
   - Most important elements (largest/boldest)
   - Supporting elements (medium weight)
   - Background elements (smallest/lightest)

**Deliverable:** Create a visual hierarchy plan that shows how contrast will guide reader attention.

### Part C: Consistency Framework (Repetition)
Develop a repetition strategy that will unify your multipage website.

**Required Framework:**
1. **Design Elements to Repeat**
   - Navigation style and placement
   - Heading treatments
   - Link styles and button design
   - Color usage patterns

2. **Content Structure Patterns**
   - Page layout templates
   - Section organization
   - Citation and reference formatting

3. **Visual Rhythm**
   - Spacing patterns
   - Image treatment consistency
   - Text block sizing

**Deliverable:** Create a style consistency guide for your website.

### Part D: Alignment and Grid Planning
Design an alignment system that will create professional, organized layouts.

**Required Planning:**
1. **Grid System**
   - How many columns will your layout use?
   - How will content align within your grid?
   - Where will text, images, and navigation align?

2. **Reading Flow**
   - How does your alignment support F-pattern reading?
   - Where will readers' eyes naturally land first?
   - How does alignment guide readers through your content?

3. **Responsive Considerations**
   - How will your alignment work on different screen sizes?
   - What alignment changes as screens get smaller?

**Deliverable:** Create a grid and alignment plan with sketches or wireframes.

## Exercise 2: From Design Principles to HTML Structure

### Part A: Translating Design to Markup
Connect your design planning to HTML structural decisions.

**Required Analysis:**
1. **Proximity → HTML Sections**
   - Which content groups need `<section>` elements?
   - When will you use `<article>` vs `<div>` for grouping?
   - How do your content groups map to HTML5 semantic elements?

2. **Contrast → HTML Hierarchy**
   - How do your heading levels (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) support your contrast plan?
   - Which content needs emphasis elements (`<strong>`, `<em>`)?
   - How will you mark up quotes, citations, and special content?

3. **Repetition → HTML Patterns**
   - What HTML patterns will repeat across pages?
   - How will navigation be consistently marked up?
   - What class naming conventions will support your repetition strategy?

4. **Alignment → HTML Structure**
   - How will your HTML structure support your planned grid?
   - Which elements need specific containers for alignment?
   - How will you structure content for responsive alignment?

**Deliverable:** Create an HTML structure plan that maps your design principles to semantic markup decisions.

### Part B: Accessibility Integration
Ensure your design principles support, rather than hinder, accessibility.

**Required Considerations:**
1. **Contrast Accessibility**
   - Color contrast ratios for text readability
   - Non-color methods of showing emphasis
   - Alternative text for images that convey contrast

2. **Structure Accessibility**
   - Logical heading hierarchy for screen readers
   - Semantic markup that supports assistive technology
   - Navigation that works with keyboard-only users

3. **Proximity and Grouping Accessibility**
   - ARIA labels for complex content relationships
   - Clear content boundaries for assistive technology
   - Logical tab order through grouped content

**Deliverable:** Accessibility checklist for your design and HTML plans.

## Reflection Questions
After completing your design planning exercises, reflect on these questions:

1. **Design Evolution:** How have your design ideas changed since your Lab 1 analysis of existing websites?

2. **Content Transformation:** What challenges do you anticipate in translating your original academic and/or creative work to web-appropriate design?

3. **User Experience:** How do your design principle applications serve your intended web readers?

4. **Technical Preparation:** How does this design planning prepare you for HTML implementation in Exercise 2?

5. **Accessibility Awareness:** How has considering accessibility influenced your design decisions?

## Submission Guidelines
