# Portfolio Project: Professional Web Development Portfolio

## Overview

This unified project integrates HTML fundamentals, design principles, CSS layout, and responsive design into a comprehensive portfolio website. Rather than separate projects, students complete four progressive labs that build skills toward a single, polished portfolio.

## Course Structure

### Four Progressive Labs
Each lab builds foundational skills while working toward the final portfolio:

1. **[Lab 1: HTML Fundamentals](Lab1_HTML_Fundamentals/)** - Semantic markup and document structure
2. **[Lab 2: Design Principles](Lab2_Design_Principles/)** - CRAP principles and typography  
3. **[Lab 3: CSS Layout](Lab3_CSS_Layout/)** - Box model and layout techniques
4. **[Lab 4: Responsive Design](Lab4_Responsive_Design/)** - Mobile-first and cross-device optimization

### Final Portfolio Project
The **[main project](Prompt/project.md)** synthesizes all lab skills into a professional portfolio website that students can use beyond the course.

## Assessment Philosophy

This course uses **ungraded, qualitative assessment** focused on:
- **Learning and growth** rather than point accumulation
- **Self-reflection** and goal-setting

### Assessment Components

**Lab Assessments:**
- Self-assessment using provided criteria (Developing → Proficient → Advanced)
- Focus on skill building and concept mastery
- Opportunity for revision and improvement

**Portfolio Assessment:**
- **[Peer review process](PeerReview/)** with structured feedback
- **[Rough draft submission](RoughDraft_PeerReview/)** for iterative improvement
- Self-reflection on learning and professional development
- Final presentation and portfolio sharing
