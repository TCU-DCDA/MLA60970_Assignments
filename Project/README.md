# Digital Remediation Project: Academic Work for Web Publication

## Overview

This unified project centers on **digital remediation**—transforming existing academic or scholarly work into compelling, accessible web content. Rather than creating a career portfolio, students complete four progressive labs that build skills toward remediating significant intellectual work for broader public engagement.

## Course Structure

### Four Progressive Labs
Each lab builds foundational web development skills while working toward thoughtful academic content remediation:

1. **[Lab 1: HTML Fundamentals](Lab1_HTML_Fundamentals/)** - Semantic markup for academic content and remediation planning
2. **[Lab 2: Design Principles](Lab2_Design_Principles/)** - CRAP principles applied to scholarly communication  
3. **[Lab 3: CSS Layout](Lab3_CSS_Layout/)** - Layout techniques optimized for reading complex content
4. **[Lab 4: Responsive Design](Lab4_Responsive_Design/)** - Cross-device accessibility for academic publishing

### Final Remediation Project
The **[main project](Prompt/project.md)** involves transforming substantial academic work (research paper, creative writing, critical analysis) into a multipage website that maintains intellectual rigor while dramatically improving public accessibility.

## Assessment Philosophy

This course uses **ungraded, qualitative assessment** focused on:
- **Learning and growth** rather than point accumulation
- **Self-reflection** and goal-setting
- **Peer collaboration** and constructive feedback
- **Professional skill development** for real-world application

### Assessment Components

**Lab Assessments:**
- Self-assessment using provided criteria (Developing → Proficient → Advanced)
- Focus on skill building and concept mastery
- Opportunity for revision and improvement

**Portfolio Assessment:**
- **[Peer review process](PeerReview/)** with structured feedback
- **[Rough draft submission](RoughDraft_PeerReview/)** for iterative improvement
- Self-reflection on learning and professional development
- Final presentation and portfolio sharing

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project sequence, students will:

### Technical Skills
- Create semantic, accessible HTML documents optimized for academic content
- Implement CSS layouts and responsive design that prioritize readability
- Apply design principles to enhance rather than distract from intellectual content
- Use modern web development tools and workflows for scholarly publishing
- Debug and optimize websites for performance and cross-browser compatibility with content-heavy sites

### Digital Liberal Arts Skills
- Transform academic writing for web audiences while maintaining intellectual rigor
- Apply content strategy principles to make scholarly work more accessible
- Understand how medium shapes message in digital vs. print scholarly communication
- Practice public scholarship and community engagement through digital publishing
- Develop critical perspective on digital humanities and online academic presence

### Critical Thinking Skills
- Analyze how design choices affect the accessibility and impact of intellectual work
- Make informed decisions about audience, accessibility, and scholarly communication ethics
- Evaluate and iterate on both content strategy and technical implementation
- Reflect on the relationship between traditional scholarship and digital publishing

## Project Timeline (4-Week Intensive)

### Week 1: Foundation and Content Analysis

## Beyond the Course

Your remediated academic work is designed for lasting impact:
- **Public scholarship** - making your intellectual work discoverable and accessible
- **Academic portfolio component** - demonstrating both scholarly work and digital skills
- **Foundation for digital humanities** - skills applicable to further scholarly web projects
- **Model for future remediation** - approach you can apply to other academic work

## Getting Started

1. **Review the [project prompt](Prompt/project.md)** to understand the remediation focus and requirements
2. **Begin with [Lab 1](Lab1_HTML_Fundamentals/)** to build HTML foundations with academic content
3. **Select substantial academic work** (research paper, creative writing, critical analysis) for remediation
4. **Consider your goals** for making this work accessible to broader audiences

## Questions and Support

This project emphasizes **digital liberal arts practice** and **public scholarship** alongside technical skill building. Focus on:
- How can web publishing make academic work more accessible and impactful?
- What are the ethical and practical considerations in scholarly digital publishing?
- How does medium shape message when moving from print to digital academic communication?
- What role does design play in supporting intellectual engagement and accessibility?
