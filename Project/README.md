# CoThis unified project centers on **content adaptation**—transforming existing academic and/or creative work into compelling, accessible web content. Students complete four progressive weeks that build skills toward adapting significant work for broader public engagement.

## Project Structure

### Four Progressive Weeks
Each week builds foundational web development skills while working toward thoughtful academic and/or creative content adaptation:

1. **[Week 1: Design and Web Writing](Week1_Design_and_Web_Writing/)** - Design principles and content planning for web adaptation
2. **[Week 2: HTML and Design](Week2_HTML_and_Design/)** - Semantic markup for content and design implementation  
3. **[Week 3: CSS Layout](Week3_CSS_Layout/)** - Layout techniques optimized for reading and content presentation
4. **[Week 4: Responsive Design](Week4_Responsive_Design/)** - Cross-device accessibility for web publishingation Project: Academic and/or Creative Work for Web Publication

## Overview

This unified project centers on **content adaptation**—transforming existing academic and/or creative work into compelling, accessible web content. Students complete four progressive weeks that build skills toward adapting significant work for broader public engagement.

## Course Structure

### Four Progressive Labs
Each lab builds foundational web development skills while working toward thoughtful academic and/or creative content adaptation:

1. **[Lab 1: Design and Web Writing](Lab1_Design_and_Web_Writing/)** - Design principles and content planning for web adaptation
2. **[Lab 2: HTML and Design](Lab2_HTML_and_Design/)** - Semantic markup for content and design implementation  
3. **[Lab 3: CSS Layout](Lab3_CSS_Layout/)** - Layout techniques optimized for reading and content presentation
4. **[Lab 4: Responsive Design](Lab4_Responsive_Design/)** - Cross-device accessibility for web publishing

### Final Content Adaptation Project
The **[main project](Prompt/project.md)** involves transforming substantial academic and/or creative work (research paper, creative writing, critical analysis) into a multipage website that maintains quality while dramatically improving public accessibility.

## Assessment Philosophy

This course uses **ungraded, qualitative assessment** focused on:
- **Learning and growth** rather than point accumulation
- **Self-reflection** and goal-setting
- **Peer collaboration** and constructive feedback
- **Professional skill development** for real-world application

### Assessment Components

**Week Assessments:**
- Self-assessment using provided criteria (Developing → Proficient → Advanced)
- Focus on skill building and concept mastery
- Opportunity for revision and improvement

**Project Assessment:**
- **[Peer review process](RoughDraft_PeerReview/)** with structured feedback
- **[Rough draft submission](RoughDraft_PeerReview/)** for iterative improvement
- Self-reflection on learning and professional development
- Final presentation and project sharing

## Beyond the Course

Your adapted work is designed for lasting impact:
- **Public communication** - making your work discoverable and accessible
- **Professional portfolio component** - demonstrating both content and digital skills
- **Foundation for digital communication** - skills applicable to further web projects
- **Model for future adaptation** - approach you can apply to other work

## Getting Started

1. **Review the [project prompt](Prompt/project.md)** to understand the adaptation focus and requirements
2. **Begin with [Week 1](Week1_Design_and_Web_Writing/)** to build design foundations with content planning
3. **Select substantial work** (research paper, creative writing, critical analysis) for adaptation
4. **Consider your goals** for making this work accessible to broader audiences

## Questions and Support

This project emphasizes **digital communication practice** and **public engagement** alongside technical skill building. Focus on:
- How can web publishing make work more accessible and impactful?
- What are the ethical and practical considerations in digital publishing?
- How does medium shape message when moving from print to digital communication?
- What role does design play in supporting engagement and accessibility?
