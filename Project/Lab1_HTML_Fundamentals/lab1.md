# Lab 1: HTML Fundamentals and Digital Remediation Planning

## Assignment Overview
This lab introduces HTML foundations while beginning the planning process for your digital remediation project. You'll practice creating semantic HTML documents and start analyzing how academic writing can be transformed for web audiences.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Understand the relationship between Markdown and HTML in digital publishing
- Create properly structured HTML documents appropriate for academic content
- Use semantic HTML elements to enhance content accessibility and meaning
- Begin analyzing academic writing for digital remediation possibilities
- Plan content strategy for transforming scholarly work into web-friendly format

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: From Markdown to HTML
Convert a formatted text document from Markdown to HTML, understanding the relationship between these two markup languages.

**Required Markdown Commands to Use:**
- Bold text → `**text**`
- Italic text → `*text*`
- Inline code → `` `text` ``
- Block quote → `>`
- Heading → `# Heading`
- Subheading → `## Heading`
- Hyperlink → `[text](URL)`
- Show Image → `![alt text](URL)`
- Bulleted list → `- item`

**Practice Text:**
Format the following paragraph in Markdown, then convert it to HTML. Focus on applying formatting based on the italicized cues within the text.

*The relationship between Markdown (MD) and HTML is practical and complementary, with Markdown offering a simpler way to write content that eventually becomes HTML behind the scenes. Both are used to structure and display content on the web, but they approach this task differently. HTML relies on a more formal system of tags and attributes, offering complete control over how information is presented, but it can be tedious or intimidating for new users. Markdown, by contrast, was designed to be easy to read and write, even in raw form, which makes it especially popular for note-taking, documentation, and content creation on platforms like GitHub or blogging tools. For example, when you want to call attention to a main idea, **this would be a good phrase to put into bold**. If you're listing reasons why Markdown is useful—make a bulleted list of the following: it's easier to write than HTML, it doesn't interrupt the flow of writing, and it converts cleanly into valid HTML code. These points would be interpreted by a Markdown parser and rendered as HTML ul and li tags. If your paragraph shifts focus slightly—**this would be a good place to insert a subheading, like "Common Use Cases for Markdown"**—which could correspond to an h2 tag in HTML. If you mention a website or online resource, **this sentence would be a good candidate for a hyperlink**, taking readers to more information. You might also insert an image here to visually compare a block of raw MD text next to the same content rendered in HTML. In collaborative writing tools or content management systems, Markdown is commonly used because it allows users to format without writing raw HTML. When quoting another source, **this section could be styled as a block quote**, which Markdown renders cleanly and accessibly. If you need to reference a command, filename, or short piece of code, **this phrase should be formatted as inline code**, which helps it stand out. While Markdown is limited in terms of advanced layout or styling, it allows raw HTML to be inserted when needed, which demonstrates the close relationship between the two. Overall, Markdown makes writing for the web faster and more approachable, while HTML remains the underlying language that browsers interpret and display. Used together, they offer both simplicity and precision, which is why they remain such common tools in digital writing and publishing.*

### Exercise 2: Academic Content Structure with HTML
Create a complete HTML5 document using sample academic content to practice markup for scholarly writing.

**Required HTML Elements:**
- Document structure: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Meta information: `<meta charset="">`, `<meta name="viewport">`, `<title>`
- Academic content elements: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<article>`, `<section>`
- Text formatting: `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<blockquote>`, `<cite>`
- Lists and references: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` for bibliographies or key points
- Links: `<a href="">` for citations and external references
- Semantic elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`

**Requirements:**
- Create a sample academic article or essay excerpt with proper HTML structure
- Include a bibliography or works cited section using appropriate list elements
- Add placeholder links for citations and external sources
- Use semantic elements to clearly delineate different parts of the academic work
- Include a header with title/author information and a footer with publication details
- Validate your HTML using W3C Markup Validator

### Exercise 3: Remediation Analysis and Planning
Analyze existing academic writing for digital remediation potential.

**Requirements:**
- **Choose a piece of your own writing** (research paper, essay, creative work, etc.) of at least 1000 words
- **Audience analysis**: Compare your original academic audience with potential web readers
- **Content audit**: Identify sections that would work well as separate web pages
- **Structure planning**: Create an outline showing how you would break the content into 4-5 web pages
- **Accessibility considerations**: Note where you might add links, images, or multimedia to enhance understanding
- **Write a brief analysis** (300-400 words) of the challenges and opportunities you see in this remediation

## Assessment Criteria

**Developing (Emerging Understanding):**
- HTML document has basic structure but may contain validation errors
- Some semantic elements used, but choices may not always be appropriate
- Content is present but may lack clear organization or purpose
- Limited understanding of HTML best practices evident

**Proficient (Good Understanding):**
- HTML document is well-structured and validates without major errors
- Appropriate semantic elements used consistently
- Content is well-organized and clearly written
- Demonstrates solid understanding of HTML fundamentals

**Advanced (Strong Understanding):**
- HTML document demonstrates sophisticated understanding of semantic markup for academic content
- Creative and thoughtful use of HTML elements to enhance scholarly meaning and accessibility
- Content analysis shows deep consideration of audience, medium, and remediation challenges
- Clear evidence of planning for effective digital transformation of academic work
- Shows understanding of how HTML structure can support different types of academic content
