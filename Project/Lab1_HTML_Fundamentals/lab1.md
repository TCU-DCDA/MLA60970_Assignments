# Lab 1: HTML Fundamentals and Document Structure

## Assignment Overview
This lab introduces the foundational concepts of HTML and web document structure. You'll practice creating semantic HTML documents that form the backbone of your final portfolio project.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Understand the relationship between Markdown and HTML
- Create properly structured HTML documents
- Use semantic HTML elements effectively
- Apply basic HTML best practices for accessibility and readability
- Begin planning content for their portfolio project

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: From Markdown to HTML
Convert a formatted text document from Markdown to HTML, understanding the relationship between these two markup languages.

**Required Markdown Commands to Use:**
- Bold text → `**text**`
- Italic text → `*text*`
- Inline code → `` `text` ``
- Block quote → `>`
- Heading → `# Heading`
- Subheading → `## Heading`
- Hyperlink → `[text](URL)`
- Show Image → `![alt text](URL)`
- Bulleted list → `- item`

**Practice Text:**
Format the following paragraph in Markdown, then convert it to HTML. Focus on applying formatting based on the italicized cues within the text.

*The relationship between Markdown (MD) and HTML is practical and complementary, with Markdown offering a simpler way to write content that eventually becomes HTML behind the scenes. Both are used to structure and display content on the web, but they approach this task differently. HTML relies on a more formal system of tags and attributes, offering complete control over how information is presented, but it can be tedious or intimidating for new users. Markdown, by contrast, was designed to be easy to read and write, even in raw form, which makes it especially popular for note-taking, documentation, and content creation on platforms like GitHub or blogging tools. For example, when you want to call attention to a main idea, **this would be a good phrase to put into bold**. If you're listing reasons why Markdown is useful—make a bulleted list of the following: it's easier to write than HTML, it doesn't interrupt the flow of writing, and it converts cleanly into valid HTML code. These points would be interpreted by a Markdown parser and rendered as HTML ul and li tags. If your paragraph shifts focus slightly—**this would be a good place to insert a subheading, like "Common Use Cases for Markdown"**—which could correspond to an h2 tag in HTML. If you mention a website or online resource, **this sentence would be a good candidate for a hyperlink**, taking readers to more information. You might also insert an image here to visually compare a block of raw MD text next to the same content rendered in HTML. In collaborative writing tools or content management systems, Markdown is commonly used because it allows users to format without writing raw HTML. When quoting another source, **this section could be styled as a block quote**, which Markdown renders cleanly and accessibly. If you need to reference a command, filename, or short piece of code, **this phrase should be formatted as inline code**, which helps it stand out. While Markdown is limited in terms of advanced layout or styling, it allows raw HTML to be inserted when needed, which demonstrates the close relationship between the two. Overall, Markdown makes writing for the web faster and more approachable, while HTML remains the underlying language that browsers interpret and display. Used together, they offer both simplicity and precision, which is why they remain such common tools in digital writing and publishing.*

### Exercise 2: HTML Document Structure
Create a complete HTML5 document with proper structure and semantic elements.

**Required HTML Elements:**
- Document structure: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Meta information: `<meta charset="">`, `<meta name="viewport">`, `<title>`
- Headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`
- Text content: `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`
- Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
- Links: `<a href="">`
- Semantic elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`

**Requirements:**
- Create an "About Me" page that will serve as content for your portfolio
- Include sections for: personal introduction, academic background, skills/interests, goals
- Use appropriate semantic HTML elements for each section
- Include at least one list (skills, interests, or accomplishments)
- Add placeholder links for future portfolio pieces
- Validate your HTML using W3C Markup Validator

### Exercise 3: Content Planning for Portfolio
Begin planning the content structure for your final portfolio project.

**Requirements:**
- Create an outline for your portfolio website (minimum 3 pages)
- Define the purpose and audience for your portfolio
- Plan your site's navigation structure
- Write brief content descriptions for each planned page
- Consider how this lab's HTML structure will support your final project

## Assessment Criteria

**Developing (Emerging Understanding):**
- HTML document has basic structure but may contain validation errors
- Some semantic elements used, but choices may not always be appropriate
- Content is present but may lack clear organization or purpose
- Limited understanding of HTML best practices evident

**Proficient (Good Understanding):**
- HTML document is well-structured and validates without major errors
- Appropriate semantic elements used consistently
- Content is well-organized and clearly written
- Demonstrates solid understanding of HTML fundamentals

**Advanced (Strong Understanding):**
- HTML document demonstrates sophisticated understanding of semantic markup
- Creative and thoughtful use of HTML elements to enhance meaning
- Content is compelling and professionally organized
- Shows consideration for accessibility and user experience
- Clear planning evident for integration with final portfolio project

## Resources and Tools
- [MDN HTML Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Course materials on semantic HTML
- HTML reference sheets and tutorials

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit both Markdown and HTML versions of Exercise 1
- Submit complete HTML file for Exercise 2
