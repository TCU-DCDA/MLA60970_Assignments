# Lab 3: CSS Implementation and Professional Web Development

## Assignment Overview
Building on the design principles from Lab 1 and semantic HTML structure from Lab 2, this lab focuses on implementing visual design through CSS while incorporating professional web development practices. You'll apply CRAP principles, create layouts that support web reading patterns, and build websites that meet professional standards for accessibility, organization, and discoverability.

## Required Preparation
This lab integrates concepts from Week 2 videos:
- **"CSS Layout and Visual Hierarchy"** (Monday, July 14) - Advanced layout techniques
- **"Typography and Accessibility in Web Design"** (Tuesday, July 15) - Professional typography and accessibility-first CSS development
- **"CSS Grid and Flexbox for Content Layout"** (Thursday, July 17) - Modern CSS layout systems

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Implement CRAP design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) through CSS
- Create visual hierarchy that supports F-pattern and layer cake reading
- Master CSS layout techniques for effective academic and/or creative content presentation
- Apply professional site organization and content management principles
- Build accessible layouts that meet web accessibility standards (WCAG guidelines)
- Implement CSS that supports SEO and content discoverability
- Apply typography and spacing principles for enhanced communication

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: CRAP Principles Implementation Through CSS
Apply the design analysis from Lab 1 by implementing CRAP principles using CSS on your Lab 2 HTML structure.

**Requirements:**
- Use your HTML files from Lab 2 as the foundation
- Implement each CRAP principle through specific CSS techniques:

**Contrast Implementation:**
- Create clear visual hierarchy using typography (font-size, font-weight, color)
- Use color contrast to emphasize key concepts and improve accessibility
- Implement spacing contrast to distinguish between content types
- Apply the contrast techniques you analyzed in Lab 1's website review

**Repetition Implementation:**
- Develop consistent styling patterns for headings, paragraphs, lists, and quotes
- Create a cohesive color scheme that reinforces credibility and professionalism
- Use consistent spacing and alignment throughout your content
- Establish visual patterns that help readers navigate your academic and/or creative content

**Alignment Implementation:**
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to create clear visual relationships between content elements
- Align text, images, and other elements to create professional presentation
- Implement proper margins and padding that support content organization

**Proximity Implementation:**
- Group related content visually through spacing, borders, or background colors
- Use CSS to enhance the semantic relationships you established in your HTML
- Create clear sections that support the web reading patterns identified in Lab 1

**Assessment for Exercise 1:**
- Document how each CSS rule implements a specific CRAP principle
- Include before/after screenshots showing design improvements
- Write analysis (200-300 words) connecting your Lab 1 insights to CSS implementation

### Exercise 2: Typography and Reading Experience Optimization
Implement typography strategies that support the web reading patterns analyzed in Lab 1.

**Requirements:**
- Apply typography CSS to enhance scannability and reduce cognitive load for academic content
- Implement font choices, sizing, and spacing that support scholarly reading online

**Typography Implementation:**
- **Font Selection**: Choose web fonts appropriate for your content (readability over decoration)
- **Hierarchy Implementation**: Use font-size, font-weight, and line-height to support F-pattern reading
- **Paragraph Optimization**: Implement spacing and width that supports the shorter paragraph strategy from Lab 1
- **List Styling**: Enhance bullet points and numbered lists to improve content scanning
- **Link Styling**: Design link states that support non-linear reading
- **Quote and Citation Styling**: Create appropriate visual treatment for quotes and important passages

**Reading Experience Features:**
- Optimal line length (45-75 characters) for comfortable reading
- Sufficient line-height for improved readability
- Strategic use of white space to reduce cognitive overload
- Color choices that support sustained reading while maintaining accessibility standards

**Assessment for Exercise 2:**
- Test your typography with actual readers or use readability tools
- Document how your choices address the web reading challenges identified in Lab 1
- Include side-by-side comparison with original text formatting

### Exercise 3: Layout Implementation for Content Presentation
Create layouts that support your multi-page content project from Lab 2.

**Requirements:**
- Use CSS Grid and/or Flexbox to implement the page structure you planned in Labs 1-2
- Create layouts specifically designed for effective academic and/or creative content presentation
- Build navigation systems that support both linear and non-linear reading

**Layout Components for Effective Content Presentation:**
1. **Article Layout**: Main content with related resources sidebar
2. **References Layout**: Accessible formatting for citations and sources
3. **Multi-page Navigation**: Clear wayfinding between sections of your adapted content
4. **Responsive Layout**: Ensure content works across devices

**CSS Layout Techniques:**
- CSS Grid for complex page layouts
- Flexbox for component-level alignment and spacing
- Responsive design that maintains professionalism on all devices
- Navigation patterns that support diverse reading workflows
- Sidebar layouts for supplementary materials

**Assessment for Exercise 3:**
- Test layouts with actual content from your project
- Ensure designs support both linear and non-linear reading patterns
- Document how layout choices enhance communication goals

### Exercise 4: Professional Web Standards and Accessibility
Implement professional web development standards including accessibility, typography, and maintainable CSS architecture.

*This exercise applies concepts from "Typography and Accessibility in Web Design" (Tuesday, July 15) and prepares for the accessibility focus that will be covered in Week 3's "Web Accessibility and Inclusive Design" video.*

**Requirements:**
- Implement CSS architecture that supports professional site organization and maintenance
- Apply accessibility standards that meet WCAG guidelines for inclusive design
