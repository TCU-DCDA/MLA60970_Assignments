# Lab 3: CSS Implementation of Design Principles

## Assignment Overview
Building on the design principles from Lab 1 and semantic HTML structure from Lab 2, this lab focuses on implementing visual design through CSS. You'll apply CRAP principles, create layouts that support web reading patterns, and style your academic content for maximum accessibility and engagement.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Implement CRAP design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) through CSS
- Create visual hierarchy that supports F-pattern and layer cake reading
- Master CSS layout techniques for academic and scholarly content presentation
- Build responsive layouts that maintain accessibility across devices
- Apply typography and spacing principles for enhanced scholarly communication

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: CRAP Principles Implementation Through CSS
Apply the design analysis from Lab 1 by implementing CRAP principles using CSS on your Lab 2 HTML structure.

**Requirements:**
- Use your HTML files from Lab 2 as the foundation
- Implement each CRAP principle through specific CSS techniques:

**Contrast Implementation:**
- Create clear visual hierarchy using typography (font-size, font-weight, color)
- Use color contrast to emphasize key academic concepts and improve accessibility
- Implement spacing contrast to distinguish between content types
- Apply the contrast techniques you analyzed in Lab 1's academic website review

**Repetition Implementation:**
- Develop consistent styling patterns for headings, paragraphs, lists, and quotes
- Create a cohesive color scheme that reinforces academic credibility
- Use consistent spacing and alignment throughout your content
- Establish visual patterns that help readers navigate your scholarly content

**Alignment Implementation:**
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to create clear visual relationships between content elements
- Align text, images, and other elements to create professional, academic presentation
- Implement proper margins and padding that support content organization

**Proximity Implementation:**
- Group related content visually through spacing, borders, or background colors
- Use CSS to enhance the semantic relationships you established in your HTML
- Create clear sections that support the web reading patterns identified in Lab 1

**Assessment for Exercise 1:**
- Document how each CSS rule implements a specific CRAP principle
- Include before/after screenshots showing design improvements
- Write analysis (200-300 words) connecting your Lab 1 insights to CSS implementation

### Exercise 2: Typography and Reading Experience Optimization
Implement typography strategies that support the web reading patterns analyzed in Lab 1.

**Requirements:**
- Apply typography CSS to enhance scannability and reduce cognitive load for academic content
- Implement font choices, sizing, and spacing that support scholarly reading online

**Typography Implementation:**
- **Font Selection**: Choose web fonts appropriate for academic content (readability over decoration)
- **Hierarchy Implementation**: Use font-size, font-weight, and line-height to support F-pattern reading
- **Paragraph Optimization**: Implement spacing and width that supports the shorter paragraph strategy from Lab 1
- **List Styling**: Enhance bullet points and numbered lists to improve content scanning
- **Link Styling**: Design link states that support non-linear academic reading
- **Quote and Citation Styling**: Create appropriate visual treatment for academic citations and quotes

**Reading Experience Features:**
- Optimal line length (45-75 characters) for academic content
- Sufficient line-height for improved readability
- Strategic use of white space to reduce cognitive overload
- Color choices that support sustained reading while maintaining accessibility standards

**Assessment for Exercise 2:**
- Test your typography with actual readers or use readability tools
- Document how your choices address the web reading challenges identified in Lab 1
- Include side-by-side comparison with original academic text formatting

### Exercise 3: Layout Implementation for Academic Content
Create layouts that support your multi-page academic remediation project from Lab 2.

**Requirements:**
- Use CSS Grid and/or Flexbox to implement the page structure you planned in Labs 1-2
- Create layouts specifically designed for scholarly content presentation
- Build navigation systems that support non-linear academic reading

**Layout Components for Academic Content:**
1. **Article Layout**: Main content with related resources sidebar
2. **Bibliography/References Layout**: Accessible formatting for academic citations
3. **Multi-page Navigation**: Clear wayfinding between sections of your remediated content
4. **Responsive Academic Layout**: Ensure scholarly content works across devices

**CSS Layout Techniques:**
- CSS Grid for complex academic page layouts
- Flexbox for component-level alignment and spacing
- Responsive design that maintains academic credibility on all devices
- Navigation patterns that support scholarly research workflows
- Sidebar layouts for supplementary academic materials

**Assessment for Exercise 3:**
- Test layouts with actual academic content from your remediation project
- Ensure designs support both linear and non-linear reading patterns
- Document how layout choices enhance scholarly communication goals

### Exercise 4: Accessibility and Inclusive Design Implementation
Ensure your CSS implementation supports diverse users and meets accessibility standards for academic content.

**Requirements:**
- Implement accessibility features that support different learning styles and abilities
- Test and refine your designs for maximum inclusivity
- Address the accessibility considerations identified in your Lab 1 content strategy

**Accessibility Implementation:**
- **Color and Contrast**: Ensure all text meets WCAG contrast ratios for academic reading
- **Focus States**: Create clear keyboard navigation for scholarly research workflows
- **Screen Reader Support**: Use CSS that enhances rather than conflicts with semantic HTML
- **Responsive Text**: Implement text that scales appropriately for different visual needs
- **Motion and Animation**: Ensure any transitions support rather than distract from content consumption

**Inclusive Design Considerations:**
- Support for different reading preferences and cognitive processing styles
- Flexible layouts that accommodate various assistive technologies
- Design choices that work across different cultural and linguistic contexts
- Visual hierarchy that supports both expert and novice readers in your academic field

**Assessment for Exercise 4:**
- Use accessibility testing tools to validate your implementation
- Test with actual users who have different abilities and technical setups
- Document how your CSS choices specifically support scholarly accessibility goals

### Exercise 5: Integration and Refinement
Bring together all elements from Labs 1-3 to create a cohesive, well-designed academic web presence.

**Requirements:**
- Integrate all CSS implementations from Exercises 1-4 into a unified design system
- Refine and polish your academic content presentation based on user testing or peer feedback
- Create a comprehensive style guide documenting your design decisions

**Integration Tasks:**
- **Design System Documentation**: Create a style guide showing how your CSS implements Lab 1's design principles
- **Content Integration**: Apply your complete design system to all pages from your Lab 2 HTML structure
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure CSS is efficiently organized and loads quickly
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Verify your academic content displays consistently across different browsers and devices
- **Final Refinements**: Make adjustments based on testing and feedback

**Comprehensive Assessment:**
