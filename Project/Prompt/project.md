# Final Project: Digital Remediation and Liberal Arts Publishing

## Project Overview

Your final project is to transform existing written work that you're particularly proud of—a research paper, creative writing, critical analysis, or scholarly and/or creative work—into a compelling, accessible multipage website for public readership. This digital remediation project integrates technical web development skills with critical thinking about how ideas travel across media, audiences, and contexts.

Throughout the four progressive labs, you've built foundational skills in HTML structure, design principles, CSS layout, and responsive design. This project applies those skills to explore how academic and/or creative work can reach broader audiences through thoughtful digital publishing.

## Project Goals

**Technical Goals:**
- Demonstrate mastery of semantic HTML and modern CSS through remediation
- Create a fully responsive website that makes content accessible across devices
- Implement design principles that enhance rather than distract from content
- Build a well-structured site that serves both content and technical learning objectives

**Intellectual Goals:**
- Explore how medium shapes message through hands-on remediation practice
- Consider questions of audience, accessibility, and public scholarship
- Analyze the relationship between print academic and/or creative writing and web-based publishing
- Practice digital liberal arts skills increasingly important in academic and/or creative professional contexts

## Required Website Elements

Your remediation project must include the following components:

### Core Pages (Minimum 4-5 Pages)
1. **Homepage/Landing Page**
   - Clear introduction to your remediated work and its significance
   - Compelling overview that draws readers into your content
   - Navigation to all sections of the remediated work
   - Brief context about the original work and remediation choices

2. **Remediated Content Pages (3-4 Pages)**
   - Your original written work transformed for web readership
   - Content restructured for scannability and web consumption
   - Strategic use of headings, sections, and visual hierarchy
   - Incorporation of relevant images, links, or multimedia where appropriate
   - Logical page breaks that enhance rather than interrupt the reading experience

3. **About the Work/Author Page**
   - Context for the original work: when, why, and for whom it was written
   - Reflection on the remediation process and decisions made
   - Information about you as author/scholar
   - Discussion of how the work fits into broader conversations or fields

4. **Sources/Bibliography Page**
   - Works cited formatted for web presentation
   - Links to external sources where available and appropriate
   - Additional resources for readers who want to explore further
   - Proper attribution and academic integrity maintained

### Technical Requirements

**HTML Requirements:**
- Valid, semantic HTML5 markup appropriate for long-form content
- Proper document structure with navigation aids for lengthy texts
- Accessible markup with appropriate headings hierarchy and ARIA labels
- Strategic use of semantic elements (article, section, aside) for content organization

**CSS Requirements:**
- External stylesheet(s) optimized for reading experience
- Typography that enhances readability across devices
- Responsive design that prioritizes content at all screen sizes
- Visual design that supports rather than competes with your content
- Consistent styling that creates unity across pages

**Content Requirements:**
- Original written work substantially revised for web readership
- Content restructured for scannability (shorter paragraphs, strategic headings)
- Visual hierarchy that guides readers through complex ideas
- Strategic use of links, images, or other media to enhance understanding

## Development Process and Workflow

### Phase 1: Content Analysis and Planning (Week 1)
- **Select and analyze your source material** - choose written work with intellectual substance
- **Audience analysis** - consider how your academic/scholarly audience differs from web readers
- **Content audit** - identify what needs substantial revision vs. light editing for web format
- **Site architecture** - plan how to break long-form work into logical, navigable sections
- **Design strategy** - consider how visual design can support and enhance your content

### Phase 2: Remediation and Structure (Week 2)
- **Content transformation** - rewrite and restructure for web readability and scannability
- **HTML implementation** - mark up content with semantic, accessible structure
- **Information architecture** - create clear navigation and logical content flow
- **Basic styling** - implement typography and layout that prioritizes readability

### Phase 3: Design Enhancement and Responsiveness (Week 3)
- **Visual design** - develop cohesive design that enhances rather than distracts from content
- **Responsive implementation** - ensure content is accessible and readable on all devices
- **User experience** - test navigation, readability, and content flow
- **Content refinement** - polish writing and remediation based on web format testing

### Phase 4: Testing and Critical Reflection (Week 4)
- **Comprehensive testing** across devices, browsers, and different reading contexts
- **Critical reflection** on remediation process and digital publishing decisions
- **Accessibility review** - ensure content is available to diverse readers and abilities
- **Final polish** and preparation for presentation and peer review

## Assessment Approach

This project uses **ungraded, qualitative assessment** focused on learning and professional development rather than traditional grading.

### Self-Assessment Questions
Reflect on these questions throughout your development process:

**Technical Mastery:**
- How effectively does your markup enhance the accessibility and usability of your content?
- Does your responsive design genuinely improve the reading experience across devices?
- How well does your visual design support rather than distract from your content?

**Remediation and Content Strategy:**
- How successfully have you transformed academic writing for web readership while maintaining intellectual rigor?
- What decisions did you make about content structure, and how do they serve your readers?
- How does your web version enhance or change the meaning and impact of your original work?

**Digital Liberal Arts Practice:**
- What does this project demonstrate about the relationship between traditional scholarship and digital publishing?
- How does making your work web-accessible change its potential audience and impact?
- What critical questions about digital media, accessibility, and public scholarship does your project raise?

### Peer Review Process
You'll participate in structured peer review sessions to:
- Get feedback on design and user experience
- Test your site on different devices and browsers
- Practice giving and receiving constructive feedback
- Learn from seeing other approaches and solutions

### Learning Documentation
Throughout the project, maintain documentation of:
- Design decisions and rationale
- Technical challenges and solutions
- Learning moments and skill development
- Resources and references used
