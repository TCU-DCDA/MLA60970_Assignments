## Assessment Approach

This project uses **ungraded, qualitative assessment** focused on learning and professional development rather than traditional grading.

### Self-Assessment Questions
Reflect on these questions throughout your development process:

**Technical Mastery:**
- How effectively does your code demonstrate HTML and CSS best practices?
- Is your website truly responsive and accessible across devices?
- How well does your implementation integrate skills from all four labs?

**Design and User Experience:**
- Does your design successfully communicate your personal brand?
- Is the user experience intuitive and professional?
- How effectively do you apply design principles to create visual hierarchy?

**Professional Development:**
- Would you be confident sharing this portfolio with potential employers or collaborators?
- How well does the content represent your skills and goals?
- What does this project demonstrate about your growth as a web developer?

### Peer Review Process
You'll participate in structured peer review sessions to:
- Get feedback on design and user experience
- Test your site on different devices and browsers
- Practice giving and receiving constructive feedback
- Learn from seeing other approaches and solutions

### Learning Documentation
Throughout the project, maintain documentation of:
- Design decisions and rationale
- Technical challenges and solutions
- Learning moments and skill development
- Resources and references used

## Professional Context and Real-World Application

This portfolio project prepares you for:
- **Job Applications**: A live portfolio demonstrating your skills
