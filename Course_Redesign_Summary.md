## Video 3 Detailed Breakdown
### "From Design Strategy to HTML Implementation" (8-10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Bridge conceptual gap between Lab 1 design thinking and Lab 2 technical implementation

**Structure:**
1. **Opening (1-2 min):** Acknowledge design-to-code challenge
2. **CRAP â†’ HTML (2-3 min):** Show how each principle informs markup choices
3. **Reading Patterns â†’ Organization (2-3 min):** Connect scanning insights to structure
4. **Content Strategy â†’ Semantics (2-3 min):** Show audience analysis informing accessibility
5. **Live Demo (1-2 min):** Before/after comparison with explanation

**Key Teaching Moments:**
- Decision-making process: "I'm choosing `<h2>` because my Lab 1 analysis showed..."
- Accessibility connection: Semantic structure serves both design and assistive technology
- Academic context: How scholarly credibility informs markup choices

**Outcome:** Students approach Lab 2 as "implementing design strategy" rather than "learning HTML syntax"

---

## Success Metrics

### **Student Experience:**
- Clear progression from design thinking to technical implementation
- Reduced confusion between labs
- Better integration of liberal arts content with web development skills

### **Learning Outcomes:**
- Students understand design principles before coding
- Technical decisions are strategic rather than arbitrary
- Academic content is effectively remediated for web publication

### **Program Alignment:**
- Better serves MLA student career goals
- Integrates digital scholarship with traditional academic skills
- Prepares students for public engagement and accessibility advocacy

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create remaining high-priority videos** (Academic Analysis, HTML Structure, Design-to-Code Bridge, Content Strategy)
2. **Test lab sequence** with pilot students or colleagues
3. **Gather feedback** on design-first approach effectiveness
4. **Refine content** based on initial implementation experience
5. **Document successful practices** for future course iterations

---

**Course Philosophy:** *Transform academic writing into accessible, engaging digital scholarship through design-driven web development that serves both scholarly and/or creative credibility and public accessibility.*
