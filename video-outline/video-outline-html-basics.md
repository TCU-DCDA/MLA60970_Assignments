## **1:00-3:30 | HTML as Content Architecture**

### **1:00-2:00 | The Content-First Mindset**
- "HTML isn't about making things look pretty - CSS does that"
- "HTML is about meaning, structure, and accessibility"
- **Screen share:** Show same content with/without CSS to demonstrate separation
- "Think of HTML as the skeleton that supports your content strategy"

### **2:00-3:00 | Document Structure Fundamentals**
- **Live demo:** Basic HTML document structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Meaningful Title for Your Content</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content lives here -->
</body>
</html>
```
- "Every piece has a purpose for content accessibility and discoverability"

### **3:00-3:30 | Why Semantic HTML Matters**
- "Semantic HTML tells browsers, screen readers, and search engines what your content means"
- "It's not just good practice - it's professional responsibility"
- "Remember: You're making your ideas accessible to diverse audiences"

## **3:30-8:00 | Essential HTML Elements for Content**

### **3:30-4:30 | Headings: Creating Content Hierarchy**
- **Live demo:** Heading structure that supports web reading patterns
```html
<h1>Main Topic (Only one per page)</h1>
<h2>Major Section</h2>
<h3>Subsection</h3>
<h2>Another Major Section</h2>
```
- "Remember the F-pattern from 'Reading Gravity'? Headings guide that scanning behavior"
- "Don't skip heading levels - it breaks accessibility"

### **4:30-5:30 | Paragraphs and Text: Supporting Readability**
- **Live demo:** Paragraph structure with emphasis
```html
<p>Clear, focused paragraphs support web reading. Keep them shorter than you would in academic writing.</p>
<p>Use <strong>strong</strong> for important concepts and <em>emphasis</em> for subtle highlighting.</p>
```
- "Shorter paragraphs serve web reading patterns - remember that from our earlier videos"

### **5:30-6:30 | Lists: Organizing Information**
- **Live demo:** Unordered and ordered lists
```html
<ul>
    <li>Key points that support scanning</li>
    <li>Information organized for quick comprehension</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Step-by-step processes</li>
    <li>Sequential information</li>
</ol>
```
- "Lists support the 'layer cake' browsing behavior we discussed"

### **6:30-8:00 | Links and Navigation**
- **Live demo:** Meaningful link text
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Read our complete accessibility guide</a>
<!-- Not: "Click here" -->

<a href="#section-2">Jump to implementation details</a>
```
- "Link text should make sense out of context - screen readers often navigate by links alone"
- "Internal links help users navigate your content efficiently"

## **8:00-12:00 | Implementing CRAP Principles with HTML**

### **8:00-9:00 | Contrast Through Structure**
- "HTML creates content contrast before CSS even touches it"
- **Live demo:** How heading hierarchy creates visual and semantic contrast
- "Your HTML structure should reflect the importance hierarchy from your content strategy"

### **9:00-10:00 | Repetition in HTML Patterns**
- **Live demo:** Consistent markup patterns
```html
<article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p class="intro">Introduction paragraph</p>
    <p>Main content...</p>
</article>
```
- "Consistent HTML patterns support both user expectations and CSS styling"

### **10:00-11:00 | Alignment Through Semantic Structure**
- "Proper HTML nesting creates logical alignment"
- **Live demo:** Well-structured vs. poorly structured HTML
- "Clean HTML structure makes your content easier to style and maintain"

### **11:00-12:00 | Proximity in HTML Organization**
- **Live demo:** Grouping related content
```html
<section>
    <h2>Related Topic</h2>
    <p>All content about this topic grouped together</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Supporting points</li>
    </ul>
</section>
```
- "HTML sections and articles create logical content groups"

## **12:00-15:00 | Professional HTML Practices**

### **12:00-13:00 | Accessibility from the Start**
- **Live demo:** Alt text, lang attributes, semantic elements
```html
<img src="chart.jpg" alt="Budget allocation showing 60% for development, 40% for marketing">
<main>
    <article>
        <header>
            <h1>Article Title</h1>
        </header>
    </article>
</main>
```
- "Accessibility isn't an add-on - it's built into good HTML from the beginning"

### **13:00-14:00 | SEO-Friendly Structure**
