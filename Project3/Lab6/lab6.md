# Lab 6: Interactive Elements and Event Handling

## Assignment Overview
This lab builds on JavaScript fundamentals to create sophisticated interactive web elements. Students will implement form validation, dynamic content updates, and user interface enhancements that prepare them for Project 3.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Implement comprehensive form validation with user feedback
- Create dynamic content that updates based on user interactions
- Build interactive UI components (modals, tabs, accordions)
- Use local storage to persist user data between sessions
- Handle multiple event types and create responsive user interfaces
- Apply JavaScript best practices for maintainable code

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Advanced Form Validation
Create a multi-field form with comprehensive validation and user feedback.

**Requirements:**
- Validate email format, password strength, and required fields
- Provide real-time feedback as users type
- Display error messages and success indicators
- Prevent form submission if validation fails
- Include custom validation for specific business rules
- Style validation states with CSS classes controlled by JavaScript

### Exercise 2: Dynamic Content Management
Build an interface for adding, editing, and removing content dynamically.

**Requirements:**
- Create a simple to-do list or note-taking interface
- Allow users to add new items through form input
- Implement edit and delete functionality for existing items
- Use local storage to save data between browser sessions
- Include search or filter functionality
- Provide user feedback for all actions

### Exercise 3: Interactive UI Components
Implement at least two interactive UI patterns from the following options:

**Component Options:**
- **Modal Window:** Opens/closes with backdrop click and escape key
- **Tabbed Interface:** Multiple content panels with tab navigation
- **Accordion:** Collapsible content sections
- **Image Gallery:** Slideshow with navigation controls
- **Dropdown Menu:** Custom dropdown with keyboard navigation

**Requirements:**
- Components must be fully functional and accessible
- Include smooth transitions using CSS and JavaScript
- Handle keyboard navigation where appropriate
- Provide clear visual feedback for user interactions

### Exercise 4: Data Persistence and State Management
Enhance your previous exercises with persistent data storage.

**Requirements:**
- Use localStorage to save user preferences and data
- Implement data export/import functionality (JSON format)
- Handle edge cases (storage full, corrupted data, etc.)
- Provide user controls for clearing stored data
- Maintain application state across page refreshes

## Technical Requirements
- External JavaScript files with modular code organization
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Accessible keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
