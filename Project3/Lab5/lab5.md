# Lab 5: JavaScript Fundamentals and DOM Basics

## Assignment Overview
This lab introduces core JavaScript programming concepts and basic DOM manipulation techniques essential for Project 3. Students will learn fundamental programming skills and how to make web pages interactive.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, students will:
- Understand JavaScript variables, data types, and basic syntax
- Write functions and use conditional statements and loops
- Access and manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript
- Handle basic user events (clicks, form inputs)
- Debug JavaScript code using browser developer tools
- Understand the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: JavaScript Basics
Create JavaScript functions that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts.

**Requirements:**
- Write functions using variables, conditionals, and loops
- Work with different data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays)
- Create functions that accept parameters and return values
- Use console.log() to display results and debug code
- Include examples of string manipulation and basic math operations

### Exercise 2: DOM Element Selection and Manipulation
Build a webpage that uses JavaScript to modify HTML content and styling.

**Requirements:**
- Use querySelector and getElementById to select elements
- Change text content, HTML content, and CSS styles dynamically
- Add and remove CSS classes using JavaScript
- Create new elements and append them to the page
- Practice both inline and external JavaScript

### Exercise 3: Event Handling and User Interaction
Create interactive elements that respond to user actions.

**Requirements:**
- Handle click events on buttons and links
- Process form input and display user-entered data
- Change page appearance based on user interactions
- Use event listeners for multiple types of user actions
- Provide visual feedback for user interactions

### Exercise 4: Simple Interactive Feature
Build a small interactive feature combining all previous concepts.

**Requirements:**
- Examples: image gallery, show/hide content, simple calculator, quiz question
- Use variables to track state or user progress
- Combine DOM manipulation with event handling
- Include user feedback and error handling
- Document your code with clear comments

## Technical Requirements
- Valid HTML5 with semantic structure
- External JavaScript file linked properly
- Clean, well-commented JavaScript code
- Cross-browser functionality (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- Professional code organization and naming conventions
