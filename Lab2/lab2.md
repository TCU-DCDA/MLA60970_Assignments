# Lab 2: Website Critique and HTML/CSS Implementation

## Assignment Overview
Create a comprehensive website critique applying the CRAP design principles, then implement your analysis using hand-coded HTML and CSS with attention to scannability best practices.

## Required HTML Elements and CSS Properties
Use these elements and properties in your implementation:

**HTML Elements:**
- Document structure: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`
- Text content: `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`
- Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
- Links: `<a href="">`
- Semantic elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`

**CSS Properties:**
- Typography: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`
- Color: `color`, `background-color`
- Spacing: `margin`, `padding`
- Layout: `width`, `max-width`, `text-align`

## Part 1: Website Critique (500-750 words)
Write an original critique of any website analyzing its design using the **CRAP principles**:

**Contrast:** How does the site use visual differences (color, size, weight) to create hierarchy and guide attention?

**Repetition:** What design elements are repeated throughout the site to create unity and consistency?

**Alignment:** How are elements positioned relative to each other? Is there a clear visual connection between related items?

**Proximity:** How does the grouping of related elements help users understand the site's organization?

Your critique should:
- Identify specific examples of each CRAP principle
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the design choices
- Suggest improvements where appropriate
- Be 500-750 words in length

## Part 2: HTML/CSS Implementation
Convert your critique into a well-structured HTML document that demonstrates scannability principles:

**Scannability Requirements:**
- Use descriptive headings that break up content into logical sections
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences maximum)
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key points
- Implement visual hierarchy through typography and spacing
- Ensure adequate white space between sections
- Use consistent styling throughout

**Technical Requirements:**
- Hand-code all HTML and CSS (no frameworks or generators)
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
- Include internal CSS in a `<style>` section within the `<head>`
- Ensure your page validates as proper HTML5
- Apply the CSS properties listed above

## Deliverables
1. One HTML file containing your critique with embedded CSS
2. Your content should be easy to scan and read on screen
3. Design should demonstrate understanding of both CRAP principles and scannability best practices

## Assessment Criteria
- **Content Quality:** Thorough analysis using CRAP principles (40%)
- **HTML Structure:** Proper use of semantic elements and document structure (25%)
- **CSS Implementation:** Effective use of required properties for typography and layout (25%)
- **Scannability:** Content is well-organized and easy to scan (10%)

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your HTML file through the course management system
- File should be named: `lastname_firstname_lab2.html`
- Ensure your file opens correctly in modern web browsers
- Include the URL of the website you critiqued in a comment at the top of your HTML file
